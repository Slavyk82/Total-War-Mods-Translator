gen_lore_emp_battle_wizards_subtitle	Battle Wizards	false
gen_lore_emp_battle_wizards_description	After the Great War Against Chaos, Magnus the Pious lifted the ancient laws against the practice of wizardry and founded the eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf. His aim was to provide a core of competent Battle Wizards so that the Empire would never again have to fight a battle without the aid of magic. Ever since, when the Emperor and his Elector Counts muster their armies to war, they will call upon the Colleges of Magic for aid, and Battle Wizards will be provided as needed.\\n\\nThe services of a Battle Wizard are much sought after by the Elector Counts, as many of their enemies employ potent shamans or fell sorcerers. Such foes bend the Winds of Magic to evil and destructive ends, and only those schooled in the arcane arts of the Colleges of Magic have any chance of countering such power.\\n\\nBattle Wizards are strange figures who wield awesome magical powers and are privy to secrets beyond the ken of normal folk. Battle Wizards learn to harness one of the Winds of Magic to their will. They dedicate many long years, sometimes decades, to studying arcane tomes and mystical scrolls, but only a fool would mistake their frail, scholarly appearance for weakness. Battle Wizards can hurl bolts of fire and lightning at their foes, confound them with terrifying illusions or snuff out their life-force like a man blowing out a candle. It is a rare army indeed that marches to war without at least one Battle Wizard at its disposal.\\n\\nThe minds of men cannot master the full spectrum of sorcery without inviting insanity. As such, each of the Colleges specialises in harnessing a separate Wind of Magic. As a result, wizards from different colleges have their own distinct sorceries, traditions and secret rituals, reflecting the nature of the magical energy they wield.\\n\\nWizards are strange and aloof men, mistrusted by most folk. No sane inhabitant of the Empire courts their attention without great need, for wizards are notoriously unpredictable and dangerous. Their mood can change from cool indifference to incandescent rage at the slightest perceived insult. The fates of those fools who have provoked their ire range from the lucky ones, who were cursed with permanent cases of the hiccups, to the less fortunate, who transformed into warty toads, or worse.\\n\\nMany who cross a wizard simply disappear altogether, leaving behind a smoking pair of boots as a warning to others. Some even whisper that Battle Wizards are tainted by the very magic they wield. As such, the citizens of the Empire tend to make superstitious gestures behind their backs when in the presence of a wizard to ward away any evil influences. \\n\\nTo be a Battle Wizard is to understand the power at the heart of the world, and though each can bend but one of the eight Winds of Magic to his will, such power is not wielded lightly. To lose control of this arcane power for even a second is to invite disaster. A misplaced syllable could result in a wizard accidentally immolating himself, along with any unfortunates who happen to be standing in his vicinity at the time. A momentary lapse of concentration might even open a portal to the Realm of Chaos that the wizard could be sucked through. None are aware of the danger more than the wizards themselves, and so while a soldier risks his life in battle, a wizard risks eternal torment.	false

gen_lore_brt_morceaux_valley_vintners_description	The wine of the Morceaux valley is said to be the best in Bretonnia (if not the whole world). In summer, the rolling chalk hills of the area are covered with vines, the produce of which is processed locally before being sent downstream to the merchants.\\n\\nSuch is the beauty of their product that even the Elves of Ulthuan have begrudgingly accepted the quality of the vintages, the High Elven emissary to Bretonnia calling it merely "tolerable".  High praise indeed coming from the Asur.	false

gen_lore_skv_plague_furnaces_description	The Plague Furnace is a disease-ridden altar to the Great Horned Rat and an unholy pulpit for a Plague Priest. It is the noisome shrine of Clan Pestilens and ruination and corruption travel in its wake.\\n\\nThe Plague Furnace is pushed into battle by chanting Plague Monks, the creaking of its iron-shod wheels audible above the drone of devotional maledictions. The decaying chassis of the Plague Furnace is riddled with woodworm, but it is the vast and ornate swinging brazier that commands attention. A glowing hot censer of wrecking ball proportions swings back and forth, issuing overwhelming heat and a roiling cloud that even simple beasts instinctively recognise as poisonous and unnatural.\\n\\nThe rhythmic swings of the infernal furnace produce an ominous sound as the pendulous censer drags through the air, leaving a trail of deadly fumes. It stings the eyes and assails the senses to gaze at the shimmering heat of the swaying globe. As the greenish vapours drift over the Plague Monks, it wets their tattered robes. This befouled fog begins to make the pox-ridden brethren twitch, their eyes bulging out in an unholy fervour for battle and blood-letting.\\n\\nAs the Plague Furnace nears the foe, the Plague Monks strain more feverishly at the ropes, increasing the momentum of the blazing orb. As the frothing brotherhood crash the Plague Furnace into the enemy battleline, the rusty chains holding the great warpstone incinerator are let slip so the vast censer plummets into the middle of the enemy unit. The unholy payload continues to spew the deadly green-tinged warpstone fumes while it is hoisted back into place.	false

gen_lore_skv_screaming_bells_subtitle	Screaming Bells	false
gen_lore_skv_screaming_bells_description	Of all the diabolical wonder weapons of the Skaven, none is as notorious as the Screaming Bell. The bell is an ever-present symbol in the creation legends of the Skaven and its mighty toll strikes deep inside the black hearts of the evil ratmen, inspiring awe and the closest thing to devotion a Skaven can achieve. It is from these unholy altars that the Grey Seers preach their plans of total domination in the name of the Great Horned Rat.\\n\\nThe wheeled carriage that supports the vast weight of the ruinous engine is pushed by a teeming horde of Skaven, but it is the colossal bell atop it that radiates power. These unholy relics are cast in the hellish warpforges beneath Skavenblight, using bronze laced with pure warpstone. The Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre aid in the casting, joining the Grey Seers in the 13-day ritual. The monotonous chittering incantations cause glowing runes of balefire to writhe mystically across the bell and as the casting is cooled, the metal is coated many times with sacrificial blood.\\n\\nRumour has it that some piece of the great tower of Kavzar is incorporated into each Screaming Bell – be it a chunk of masonry or some small part of the Great-Bell-That-Began-It-All melted and forged anew. To work the immense weight, Clan Moulder supplies the pick of its hell-birthed litters – the most hulking of Rat Ogres.\\n\\nIn battle the ominous tolling of the bell resounds above the clamour of the fighting, a message of death to foes, but a declaration of supremacy that reverberates inside the children of the Horned Rat. The deadly peal drives Skaven recklessly forward in a fury that will be assuaged by nothing short of the total and complete annihilation of the enemy.\\n\\nThe thunderous BONNNNNNNNNNG! is magically amplified and those that hear it and survive cannot find the words to describe the cacophony of horrible sounds that emit from the unholy Bell. With each toll the din grows louder and more terrible, rising to a crescendo of sound until the very mind seems to split asunder. The relentless aural assault causes the very stone to split and buildings to crumble. Doom, Doom, Doom it seems to endlessly say... all will fall, all will be ruinous, Doom, Doom, Doom.	false

gen_lore_vmp_barded_nightmares_description	Vampires do not ride to battle atop mounts of mortal flesh and blood. The steeds of the Vampire aristocracy are unnatural destriers called Nightmares. Some Nightmares are the carcasses of dead warhorses, brought back to life through necromantic magic. Though their flesh is withered and their skin pocked and rank, these mighty steeds are infused with Dark Magic and can easily bite or kick a soldier to death. Other Nightmares are sorcerous constructs of sinew, bone and metal, empowered by magic.\\n\\nThe most impressive Nightmares are those born out of defiled flesh and bone, reared on fresh blood until they stand tall and proud. Their shadowy flanks shimmer with magical energy, their eyes glow like hot coals and their hooves burn with a coruscating magical flame. Smoke snorts from a Nightmare's flaring nostrils, carrying the stench of brimstone and decay. These beasts are often clad in heavy barding or wear caparisons of rusting chainmail, and spiked barding on their bodies to tear at the flesh of their foes.	false

gen_lore_vmp_hellsteeds_subtitle	Hellsteeds	false
gen_lore_vmp_hellsteeds_description	Some types of Nightmare are known as Hellsteeds. Although at first glance a Hellsteed is a winged horse, it is far stranger than any mortal creature. Its skin is thick and covered in hard scales, and its head is ridged with protective protrusions of bone. When cut by a foe's blade, its blood hisses black and fills the air with the stench of sulphur. Its long fangs and claws are easily capable of disembowelling an armoured man.\\n\\nA Hellsteed's wings are bat-like and broad of span, tipped with talons. Some Hellsteeds have no skin, their exposed tendons and muscles stretching and bunching as they power through the air on powerful pinions. Hellsteeds often have manes and tails of flame, matching the fires that burn in their eye sockets.\\n\\nHellsteeds are notoriously vicious, and Vampires that dabble in the binding of beasts delight in breaking these wild creatures to their will. In battle, Hellsteeds are driven mad by the scent of blood and strain at their reins, eager to trample their prey into the dirt as they plunge into the fray.	false

gen_lore_vmp_zombie_dragons_subtitle	Zombie Dragons	false
gen_lore_vmp_zombie_dragons_description	In death, no creature is beyond the powers of the Vampire. From the smallest bat to the mightiest Manticore, every man, monster or beast can be pulled from death's embrace and bound to fight once more for a new master. The elder race of Dragons is no exception. Those Vampires gifted in the art of necromancy bind the corpses of the great drakes to their will, resurrecting them as Zombie Dragons. These once-majestic creatures stagger upright once more with a great despairing roar before stooping to allow their new master to ride atop their powerful shoulders. Wreathed in a fog of rot and surrounded by swarms of blood-hungry flies, a Zombie Dragon can turn the tide of a battle purely by dint of its horrific presence.\\n\\nNorth of the Land of the Dead, east of the Worlds Edge Mountains, lies the Plain of Bones. The Plain of Bones is a desert of multicoloured refractive sand from which protrude huge rib cages many times larger than a man. This is the place where Dragons once came to die, to rest their bones amongst those of their ancestors as they had done for millions of years, before any other sentient beings walked the world. Here lie the bones of the great ancestral Dragons: skulls the size of castle towers lie mingled with leg bones larger than the mightiest Drakwald oak. These bones date from the great days of the draconic race. Though today's Dragons are of a lesser breed, they are still incomparably mightier than other races of the world.\\n\\nIn the time before the first great Chaos incursion, Dragons flew to this parched land when they knew their time of dying was upon them. At the end of their last flight, they would lie where they fell. No one knows what instinct drew them but over the long millennia, thousands came here in their last hours. This continued until the time of the first great Chaos incursion, when dark power seeped out of the frozen north and malignant evil entered the corpses of the dead Dragons.\\n\\nThe deceased monsters stirred once more, their eyes bright with unnatural light. These fell abominations still prowl the Plain of Bones, evil and near mindless, driven by terrible, unnatural hungers. Dragons are proud creatures, and those that survived the coming of Chaos do not willingly submit themselves to such a fate. They no longer come here to die, though none save the Dragon-riding nobles of Ulthuan know where they now go to end their days.\\n\\nWhen they are still among the living, Dragons swallow vast amounts of gold and gems to aid their digestion. These line their stomach, the grinding action helping to break down the vast meals that Dragons devour. When they die, their glittering carcasses contain a king's ransom for those brave enough to claim it. There are always those who become bold when treasure is involved, but in a land devoid of drinkable water and home to poisonous and mutated monsters, death comes to these treasure seekers easily. Some die after drinking from toxic wells, while others fall prey to the great Zombie Dragons that prowl that godless realm, leaving their victims' bones strewn across the sands.\\n\\nThese perils mean little to the Undead, however, so it is to the Plain of Bones that a Vampire travels to claim a Zombie Dragon as its mount. Animated by Dark Magic, a Zombie Dragon is borne aloft by great tattered wings, its body covered with thick, withered hide. Though in life it once breathed fire capable of melting steel, a Zombie Dragon can only belch forth a cloud of pestilent gas which strips flesh from bones and corrodes armour.\\n\\nA Zombie Dragon's claws and sword-like teeth remain as deadly as they ever were, and it is capable of ripping an armoured knight in half and swallowing his warhorse in one motion. When such a monster is used as a steed by a powerful Vampire Lord, even the greatest heroes quail before the raw might of undeath, for the combined might of hero and mount is enough to break the back of any army.	false

gen_lore_emp_temple_sigmar_altdorf_description	The Holy Temple of Sigmar, also called the Great Cathedral, or the Cathedral of Sigmar Risen and Transformed, is the centre of the Cult of Sigmar. It is the seat of the Grand Theogonist and is considered one of the true marvels of the Old World. It is, in of itself, the largest and most powerful religious hub within the Empire and beyond. Some argue it holds more power than the Emperor's Palace.\\n\\nThe Cathedral's magnificent carved stone facades dominate the city around it, and the building demonstrates to all good citizens for miles around the awesome power of the cult, of Sigmar, and of the Empire. The main hall of the temple is truly one of the marvels of the Old World.\\n\\nIt has a massively high arched ceiling, overlooked by countless balconies and precarious gantries. It is estimated that the Temple can accommodate thousands of worshipers. The building was constructed, renovated, embellished, and enhanced over the centuries, and has ancient wings and almost-forgotten corners and sections forbidden to all but ordained priests of Sigmar.\\n\\nThe reliquary below the temple boasts many sacred and powerful artefacts, but pride of place is taken by the Shroud of Magnus, rumoured to be the very burial cloth used when Magnus the Pious was interred. If the rumours are true, the shroud could be one of the most precious relics in the entire Old World.	false

gen_lore_nor_hakka_the_aesling_subtitle	Hakka the Aesling	false
gen_lore_nor_hakka_the_aesling_description	Hakka the Aesling was a Chaos Champion of Khorne who hailed from the frozen land of Norsca. A frenzied berserker by reputation, many foes had fallen to the whirlwind fury of his twin battle-axes, their skulls made to garland the Throne of Khorne.\\n\\nIn the Year of the Crow, in the Sixth Reign of the Black Moon by the Norscan reckoning, Hakka emerged from Norsca, travelling eastwards towards the Kurgan lands and the dreaded city of Zanbaijin on the plateau of K'datha with his mighty warband of berserkers and bloody beasts to answer the call of war that no Northman, be they Aesling, Graeling or Varg, could deny; war at the pleasure of the Chaos Gods.\\n\\nWith the call to war tugging at his mind and soul, the Norscan wasted no time in heeding the summons of his god. Feeling the breath of Chaos upon his nape and the promises of the gods ringing in his ear, Hakka, like many champions and warlords of the North, bestirred himself for battle.\\n\\nIt wasn't long until he came across Tamurkhan, Champion of Nurgle, with his army of plague-ridden wretches and savage beasts. The two sides clashed in the bloody snow, each fighting eagerly for their Chosen God's favour. Against the insurmountable fury of the Aesling Khorne-worshippers, the lines of the Children of Nurgle wavered and buckled. At first it seemed dangerously certain their front line would break against such power.\\n\\nThe Aeslings slaughtered their foes in droves, dedicating each kill as a sacrifice to Khorne, and Hakka was in the throes of his berserker rage, slaughtering his foes with vicious abandon and roaring for Tamurkhan's head. The press of battle swept Hakka from his sword-brothers, however, and left him surrounded by the slaves of Nurgle.\\n\\nThough thousands fell to the whirlwind fury of his twin axes, not even a warrior such as Hakka could overcome such odds, and in the end, the Aesling Warlord was torn apart by four hulking Bile Trolls.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the remnants of Hakka's warriors reluctantly pledged themselves to Tamurkhan's war-banner, following Nurgle's Champion on his quest for the fabled Throne of Chaos.	false

gen_lore_nor_bjornlings_description	Bjornlings are one of two of the more cosmopolitan and less Chaos influenced tribes in Norsca, as their lands lie farthest from the Chaos Wastes. They are brave traders who always had connections to all the lands in Old World. Many of the famous Norse explorers have risen among them.\\n\\nEven though Bjornlings are traders and explorers, it doesn't change the fact that they are also reavers. Chaos marks are less common among Bjornlings and they do not commonly worship the Dark Gods. There are times when they have been forced to join the forces of Chaos, but it is a rare event.\\n\\nBjornlings have a very good relationship with Norse Dwarfs, probably because of their non-Chaotic nature. Dwarf trade caravans' travel through Norsca using secret underground passages to trade with them from time to time.\\n\\nBjornlings are fierce rivals with their northern neighbours, the Graelings. This is an ancient hatred with an unknown cause that has resulted in many wars and useless deaths. Even though Bjornlings usually consider Aeslings as enemies too, it does not come close to the hate between Bjornlings and Graelings.	false

Only in hours of greatest need does the Merwyrm rouse and rise to the surface to consume those who would bring about Lothern's ruin.\\n\\nThe records kept in the Glittering Tower tell that Amanar has manifested but three times in recorded history. The first was during the Daemon invasion, where he swallowed whole a legion that laid siege to the city. The second came during the Sundering, where his broad back held Lothern high above the tidal waves that swamped Ulthuan.\\n\\nThe third, and to date final, appearance of Amanar came during the Great Incursion. With a great sweep of his tail, he scattered much of the Dark Elf army; then, ignoring the pinpricks of their blades, he turned and bore the Black Ark Intolerable Delight beneath the waves, never to be seen again.	false

gen_lore_hef_battle_of_wailing_fen_description	Through confluence of wind and ill fate, the enchanted mists about the Shrouded Shore billowed and thickened. As they grew ever more dense, their accumulated magics shone like a beacon within the Realm of Chaos. Thus did Daemons find purchase upon the lands of Yvresse.\\n\\nThe Elves met the daemonic host on the outward edge of Wailing Fen. Moranion of Athel Tamarha, father of Eltharion, rode at their head. He was owed many favours by princes of other lands, and so the tall spearmen of his holdings were joined by warriors of Chrace, Eataine, and even further afield. Moranion would need all their skill and valour in the hours to come.\\n\\nAt the battle's height, a Bloodthirster descended from the skies, roaring and bellowing as it carved bloody ruin through a regiment of White Lions. The woodsmen of Chrace fought on, even though they knew that they were overmatched. Their fortitude was soon repaid with salvation: a Flamespyre Phoenix, fire streaming behind, dove out of the darkness to rake the Bloodthirster with its mighty talons.\\n\\nWith a thunderous crack, the Daemon's whip lashed out, coiling around the firebird's neck. The Phoenix shrieked in fury as its mighty wings strove in vain to bear it aloft once more, but the Bloodthirster was too strong. Oblivious to the White Lions' axe-blows, the Daemon hauled the beast close and tore out its throat with savage fangs. Casting the Phoenix's corpse to the ground, the Bloodthirster roared in triumph.\\n\\nYet the fires of the fallen Phoenix did not extinguish with its death. They continued to blaze, growing ever hotter and more furious with each passing moment. The White Lions fell back as their cloaks caught alight, but the Bloodthirster, maddened with gore-lust, came on through the flames. Three steps had the Daemon taken when there was a thunderous boom; the Phoenix's body exploded in a shower of smouldering plumage, and a column of fire spiralled into the sky.\\n\\nCaught at the conflagration's heart, the Bloodthirster's flesh blackened and cracked but, insensate to pain, it came on, hungry for blood. Indeed, so intent was it on claiming the skulls of the remaining White Lions, that it did not notice the flames draw together and coalesce into a new form – the Phoenix reborn.\\n\\nIt took but a moment for the Flamespyre Phoenix to sight its erstwhile slayer and, giving out a great shriek, it dove to the attack. On hearing the cry the Bloodthirster turned but, before the Daemon could bring its weapons to bear, the Phoenix was upon it once more. Talons sank deep into the Bloodthirster's shoulders and an iron-hard beak punched through the Daemon's armour to pierce the black heart within its chest.\\n\\nWith one last bellow, the Daemon's mortal form perished, and its spirit was cast back into the Realm of Chaos. With this final blow, the battle was won. As the Bloodthirster fell, the magic sustaining his army began to unravel. The Daemon army faded back into the mists, and peace fell upon Yvresse for a time.	false

gen_lore_hef_fate_of_the_spirit_description	To hungry gods, Elven spirit-stuff is the most delectable of all prizes. Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos, is rapacious in all his appetites, but thirsts for Elven souls beyond all others. Those few who escape his maw must then evade the grasp of Ereth Khial, the Pale Queen. Such fates are truly worse than death, ending either in total obliteration of the soul, or torment without end.\\n\\nTo guard against such fates, all High Elves are spiritually bound to the waystones of their ancestral lands. From the moment of binding onwards, each Elf feels a powerful connection to the land upon which his waystone rests, though he may spend a lifetime wandering other lands. Many High Elves carry wayshards, small gemstones attuned to the network of waystones that allow their bearers to “feel” the position of individual stones, and thus navigate the world.\\n\\nWhen an Elf dies, his soul is drawn to his bound waystone, and becomes part of the ritual that sustains the Great Vortex. In this way, the folk of Ulthuan continue to protect, in death, the world they defended in life. It is even said that, at midnight, the hills and fields about a waystone tremble to the gallop of invisible hooves and ring with the din of a battle that lies beyond mortal sight.\\n\\nThus is the loss of even a single waystone a terrible tragedy. Not only does its fall diminish the magics of the Great Vortex, but with its destruction, the spirits within lose their anchor, and are left defenceless before the gaze of predatory gods.	false

gen_lore_hef_the_great_vortex_subtitle	The Great Vortex	false
gen_lore_hef_the_great_vortex_description	Ulthuan is spanned by a network of waystones – towering rune-carved menhirs that channel and redirect the Winds of Magic. Each waystone collects the raw power of Chaos and directs it to an inward neighbour. Thus are the magical energies of the world inexorably drawn, like the waters of a whirlpool, to Ulthuan's heart. There the magic is drained from the world by the Great Vortex; the last – and most brilliant – enchantment of Caledor the Great.\\n\\nThe Great Vortex is centred on the Isle of the Dead, the ancient memorial ground of the Elves. It is not a true island, but rather an archipelago of waystones whose arrangements are laid in symbols of mystical significance. These menhirs vary greatly in size – some are scarce a dozen feet tall and slim as an Elf, whilst others are as tall as mountains and nearly a mile in girth. Without the latent spiritual energy contained within these waystones, the conjuration of the Great Vortex would have been impossible.\\n\\nThe Isle of the Dead exists outside time, beyond the reach of the physical world – its black-robed guardians keep a grim watch to ensure it remains that way. If an intruder were to be allowed upon these haunted shores, he would find the High Elf mages of old, caught like flies in amber, still chanting their ages-long spells to preserve the balance of the world.\\n\\nDespite the Great Vortex, magic has left its mark on Ulthuan. Strange lights flicker in the skies, beautiful voices dance upon the wind and waterfalls resonate with otherworldly music. Indeed, Ulthuan's entire being is now sustained by magic. During a time known as the Sundering, the continent was wracked and shattered, its remnants saved from the hungry sea by desperate enchantments. Only by harnessing the vast power drawn in by the waystones can the Elves ensure that Ulthuan is not swallowed up by the ocean.	false

Many spawnings are predicted in the Sacred Plaques, while others occur without warning, and are always treated as holy portents of great significance.\\n\\nThe war against the Skaven Clan Pestilens was heralded when the Sacred Pools of Reflected Rain Clouds were poisoned by the foul ratmen, cruelly malformed Lizardmen crawling forth to die within hours. Spawning pools are amongst the most sacred of places to the Lizardmen, and the loss of even one is a great tragedy.	false

gen_lore_lzd_lizardmen_weapons_description	A great many of the brutal weapons of the Lizardmen are made from a material unique to Lustria. Harder than granite, the strange stone is known as obsinite, and it is a glossy jet black, although some obsinite quarried from the Watchotep Swamp bears a tinted marble-like quality.\\n\\nObsinite is more durable than steel and it never rusts. Skink artisans often reinforce or decorate the stone armaments with bands of bronze or gold, sometimes inscribing upon them the glyphs of the Old Ones. Jagged spikes of metal or cruelly shaped pieces of jade are added to ensure the heavy, blunt weapons can punch through armour and cause maximum damage to flesh. Skink Priests will often offer blessing over favoured weapons, adding feathers or gemstones in order to attract the favour of Sotek, or of the Old Ones.	false

gen_lore_lzd_throne_ancients_description	During the Great Catastrophe, the planet was contaminated. Since then, Slann have avoided setting even a single toe upon the earth, for this grounds their magical power and disrupts their thoughts.\\n\\nWhilst ensconced in their pyramid-temples, the Mage-Priests sit enthroned upon a leaf-cushioned litter in the centre of a pool of tranquil water. They often spend days upon days studying the lights reflected in the pool’s shimmering surface whilst the fumes of the jungle lotus cloud the air.\\n\\nWhen the Mage-Priests go to war, they do so upon floating palanquins made of stone and other, unknown substances. These palanquins are magical artefacts of a long-lost age, and although the Slann can control their movements with but a thought, the secrets of their construction have long since been lost. About the palanquin shimmers the potent Shield of the Old Ones, keeping the Mage-Priest safe from enemy bow fire.\\n\\nLord Mazdamundi has ordered his palanquin mounted upon the back of a mighty Stegadon, combining the arcane protection offered by the stone throne with the obvious advantages of being able to command his army from the back of such an impressive beast.	false

gen_lore_lzd_due_sacrifice_description	Ever since the coming of the Serpent God, the Lizardmen have been engaged in a constant war against the Skaven. Although the armies of the ratspawn were long ago expelled from Lustria, still small numbers infest the swamps and lurk in the dank tunnels beneath long-abandoned temples.\\n\\nThe Lizardmen's patrols seek out these intruders and, where possible, capture them, bringing them to one of the great temple-cities. Here the ratmen are interred in great pits, each crammed full of squirming, squealing filth-encrusted vermin. \\n\\nAt the appointed time in the lunar cycle, these captives are drugged with potent soporific fumes and led from the stinking pits. One by one, they are brought to the top of the city's Great Pyramid, to stand before a Skink Priest. The Skink invokes the names of the Old Ones, offering up the coming sacrifice as the Old Ones sacrificed themselves to save the world at the moment of the Great Catastrophe. And then, the Skaven is sacrificed.\\n\\nThe form of the sacrifice varies depending on the Old One to which the temple-pyramid is dedicated. Most are dedicated to Sotek, and so the prisoner is cast into a deep shaft, the bottom of which is home to a thousand blood vipers or perhaps one of the mighty Coiled Ones. Other offerings take the form of ritually burning, drowning or exsanguinating the captured Skaven. \\n\\nOn occasion, a mighty Skaven warlord will be captured. The ceremony of offering up such a prisoner to the Old Ones is of great import, and it is not uncommon for the greater part of the entire temple-city's population to gather in the great square to witness it.\\n\\nThe ceremony will be officiated over by the most senior Skink Priest, and frequently, the killing blow will be delivered by the mightiest Saurus leader present. According to the archival records, it is Kroq-Gar who has made the greatest number of such offerings, having sacrificed over a thousand mighty Skaven warlords since the dawning of the age of the Serpent God Sotek.	false

By entering a deep trance, the Mage-Priests are able to transmit their thoughts from one another throughout the entirety of the web, enabling them to hold councils of “sublime communion”.\\n\\nThe oldest and most powerful Mage-Priests are able to send their spirits soaring along the geomantic web, allowing them to bring their prodigious magical powers to bear far from their otherwise weak and vulnerable bodies.	false

gen_lore_lzd_jungle_lotus_description	In hidden groves deep in the jungle is to be found a plant so rare that an entire caste of Skinks is dedicated to locating and harvesting it. The jungle lotus is a plant of magical aspect that grows only in the wild, for not even the magic of the Slann can force it to grow elsewhere.\\n\\nAn intruder stumbling into a grove in which the jungle lotus grows will be overcome by the heady aromas, to drift into a dream of other planes of existence. His flesh will become one with the loamy soil from which the plant draws its sustenance. It is even said that the victim’s very life essence is taken up into the plant as well, and is the source of its mystical nature.\\n\\nThe Lizardmen treasure the jungle lotus greatly, for it has a singular effect upon the metabolism of the Slann. Once a grove is located, the Skinks carefully gather a crop, from which is prepared using secret methods a unique, magical concoction. This is burned in censers in the eternity chambers of the Slann, allowing them to enter the deepest of meditations.\\n\\nIt is said that when they inhale the fumes of the jungle lotus the Slann shed the manacles of their earthly existence and their spirits soar free to the ends of the universe. Such spirit-journeys may take minutes or decades, with the Slann entirely unaware of how much time has passed in the physical world while they are engaged upon their quests for the Old Ones.\\n\\nAside from the Slann, the only creatures capable of inhaling the fumes of the jungle lotus without their spirit fleeing their body never to return are the Saurus Temple Guard. For this reason, the Slann’s chamber is sealed airtight before the lotus is burned, and any Skink attendant seeking entry will only do so in the direst of circumstances.	false

gen_lore_lzd_thunder_lizards_description	Thunder Lizards are behemoths, so large they dwarf even the mighty Stegadons. Their tread shakes the earth and their deafening roar can be heard for miles. They devastate the jungle with their passing, leaving miles-long trails of broken trees and tramped vegetation behind.\\n\\nFortunately for the Lizardmen, Thunder Lizards are rare and the jungles so massive that the two species seldom come into contact. Should a Thunder Lizard’s distant roar be heard, then runners will be sent to the nearest temple-city and the populace roused lest the beast’s path take it near.\\n\\nA Thunder Lizard passing through a city is akin to a natural disaster of the kind that sunk Chupayotl. The chief defence against a Thunder Lizard is for a Slann to bring his formidable powers to bear on the creature’s simple mind, forcing it to turn aside from the city and take an alternative path through the jungle.\\n\\nThere has been one instance in which a Thunder Lizard could not be turned aside. During the time of Lord Amoxixan’s second ascension, one of these mighty behemoths was observed locked in deadly combat with some form of sea monster that had risen from the depths and come inland from the Tarantula Coast. The combat between the two creatures lasted an entire cycle of the moons, and destroyed vast swathes of the jungle.\\n\\nAt the last, the combatants smashed through the outer limits of Hualotal, the City of Masks. Though many Slann pooled their magical powers, the Mage-Priests were unable to penetrate the beasts’ frenzied minds to steer them clear.\\n\\nWhen the warring beasts had finally passed on, entirely unaware of the destruction they had wrought in their passing, the ancient Temple of the Lost had been destroyed, along with countless numbers of the irreplaceable relics that had been housed within since before the time of the Great Catastrophe.	false

For brief moments the Slann Mage-Priest’s vision cleared and he remembered he was searching – seeking for something, although exactly what he sought was no longer clear.\\n\\nAn overwhelming lethargy slows his every effort and even that he was looking for something was an ephemeral thought, a notion that hovered elusively just beyond his grasp. All that changed when Subatuun was rediscovered, and Huaxhini’s Eternity Chamber reintegrated into the Geomantic Web.\\n\\nThrough his dream-haze Lord Huaxhini heard a call – a distant voice within his mind – a faraway entreaty from Lord Mazdamundi. It was this message that recalled Lord Huaxhini, guiding him to cast off the spell that enthralled him. With a lurch his bloated body startled awake for the first time in generations.\\n\\nIn that instant the Mage-Priest was flooded with visions. He saw powerful enemy forces mustering, as well as the recovered messages of the Old Ones. Lord Huaxhini’s eyes blazed with magical fury as he once more remembered his Great Purpose.	false

She is ever locked in a jealous contest with her twin sister Atharti, the Goddess of Pleasure, and resents her sway over mortals. It was supposedly this rivalry that first enticed Hekarti to grant wisdom to Morathi. That said, the Hag Sorceress has always kept her devotions to the two sisters in careful balance – Naggarothi legends have many grim examples of what happens to those who favour one above the other.	false

gen_lore_def_ancient_traditions_description	Dark Elf society is rigidly structured, its titles and positions stemming from the ancient traditions of pre-Sundering Nagarythe. New ranks and honours are created only on the rarest occasions, and most of those are abolished at Malekith’s decree as soon as he hears of them.\\n\\nFor the Witch King to do otherwise would suggest that the royal traditions of Nagarythe were somehow flawed, and if there is one truth closer to Malekith’s black heart than any other, it is that the Nagarythe of old was a realm beyond all reproach.\\n\\nThis underlying order goes entirely unnoticed by those few outsiders who glimpse the inner workings of Naggaroth. Seeing the constant stream of politicking, disgrace, betrayal and assassination, they confuse an attack upon the person holding a particular position with an attack upon the position itself. Yet no Dark Elf wishes to see these ancient titles cast down, for there is no more effective way of measuring one’s worth than by reckoning the minions that grovel below and the fools who preen above.\\n\\nAny noble could easily carve out an entirely new fiefdom in the blasted landscape of Naggaroth. That none of them do so is because such achievement would never bestow the same status as rising to high rank in one of the great cities. Worse, it would be taken as an acknowledgement of weakness by those the Dreadlord seeks to call his peers, and weakness is seldom tolerated long in Naggaroth.	false

gen_lore_def_names_of_power_description	Family ties are seldom flaunted in Naggaroth. For a Dark Elf to achieve true renown, he must do so through his own actions, not through the long-ago deeds of some withered sire. For this reason, few Dark Elves betray their lineage in name or title, but instead adopt warrior names chosen to strike fear into the hearts of their allies and enemies.\\n\\nSuch titles must be backed up by deeds if they are to have any chance of gaining acceptance and renown, so it is common for Dark Elf lordlings to adopt names that reflect their vile proclivities, or that can at least be proven by fearsome acts.\\n\\nA Naggarothi who assumes the warrior name “Venomblade” had best go to battle with his weapons coated in the deadliest of poisons, lest he suffer mockery – and likely a poisoned death – at the hands of his peers. Similarly, a noble who takes the name Severspine will go to almost theatrical lengths to remind other Dark Elves of its appropriateness.\\n\\nCuriously, some of these warrior names have now become so renowned that they are handed down, in exactly the same way as the family names that have been all but abandoned. Thus have the sons of five generations borne the Fellheart name, and thus has a warrior named Chillblade served at Malekith's right hand since his ascension – even though no Elf of that name has lived longer than a hundred years.\\n\\nThe Dark Elves see nothing contradictory in this behaviour, for while a family name is granted merely for having been born, a warrior name will only be ceded to a progeny who has performed the deeds to deserve it. As such, the latter will always be worth more than the former, even if both are handed down through the blood.	false

Ghyran is the Aethyr's echo and mirror of fertility and the nurturing aspects of mortal life. This brimming energy has granted the spells powered by Ghyran their title as the "Lore of Life".\\n\\nGhyran is said to fall upon the mortal world in a manner similar to rainfall upon the earth. Those with witchsight claim to be able to see Ghyran form into pools and swirling eddies of green-hued magical energy that gradually form into rivers, flowing across the land like water, though unbound by physical laws.\\n\\nWhen the Winds of Magic blow most strongly, Ghyran flows across the lands like a great tide, sinking into the soil and drawn to the rivers, waterways, lakes, and springs of the mortal world. Its energy is particularly attracted to water and saturates the earth with its life-giving power. It is drawn up through the roots of all plants it comes into contact with, feeding all living things, and encouraging their growth.	false

It is known as a savage Wind, the antithesis of civilisation and domestication, as primal and unreasoning as it is devoid of malice.\\n\\nGhur is attracted to animals and wild places in equal measure, retreating from the ordered existence of Elves and their halls. This is reflected in the misanthropic ways of its practitioners – shunning all civilisation for the wild mountains and moors, where the Wind of Ghur blows free.	false

Although diffuse and difficult to manipulate, Hysh is a constant and steady luminance, the complete opposite of Chaos' randomness.\\n\\nHysh has many potent applications, in healing, protection, and the banishment of evil.

gen_lore_wef_eldrazor_description	Eldrazor is the patron of duellists and of those who yearn to fight battles for the sake of honour. As such, his favour is often sought by warriors of the Eternal Guard – especially on the eve of a trial by combat. Yet Eldrazor’s favour is also valuable in battle – at least if the combatants fight for a just cause, rather than of mindless barbarism.\\n\\nSo it is that one of the oldest traditions of the Eternal Guard is to ritually consecrate regions of Athel Loren and mark them with crossed-dagger pendants and finger-bone totems. Thus are many of the forest’s glades sanctified as mortal extensions of Eldrazor’s otherworldly Arena of Death.\\n\\nIt is said that the Lord of Blades pays special attention to those battles fought upon his holy ground, and will even intervene if he is moved to do so. As a result, the Eternal Guard habitually plan any defence of Athel Loren around these key sites. Mortal valour and skill is all very well, they say, but only a fool passes up the opportunity to have a god join the battle.	false

Yet still he labours, night and day, to create weapons of incredible potency to aid both gods and Elves, his tears of shame hissing upon the forge and falling to the mortal world as shards of flint.\\n\\nVaul hates Khaine but toils without once considering rebellion. The Maker can see the coming doom of the Elves and knows they will need all of Khaine's might and fury to survive it.\\n\\nGlade Guards revere Vaul greatly, for a hunter is naught without a quiver of arrows that fly true. Regardless of rank or station, all Wood Elves craft their own arrows; something so crucial to survival should never be left to another's hand.\\n\\nEvery Glade Guard carries a single flint-headed arrow, lovingly crafted from a stone from the realm of Torgovann inscribed with the words “Ethris Yl Idrion” – the Maker's Tear. Such a weapon is used against only the direst of foes; a shard of godly sorrow should not be wasted upon inconsequential enemies.	false

Others bury their dead deep in the ground, where the hungry roots of the trees can easily draw nourishment from the mouldering remains.\\n\\nSuch traditions are important to the Wood Elves, and form a key part of their pact with the forest. If an Elf is slain in distant lands, they are brought home to Athel Loren, even though thousands of leagues might lie in between.\\n\\nIf this is impossible, as is often the case during times of war, Treemen and Dryads are bidden to feast upon the corpse, so they at least may gain from the tragedy. Such practices are abhorrent to the Elves of other lands, but to the Wood Elves they are simply another aspect of the Weave.	false

Alas, few Elven deities can offer salvation, for the Chaos Gods broke the power of the Elven pantheon long ago. Those few that can still intercede are either unreliable, or else offer an outcome scarcely less dire.\\n\\nTo avoid this terrible fate, the Wood Elves made a pact with Athel Loren that extends far beyond their mortal bodies. When a Wood Elf perishes, the forest he has tended for so long absorbs his spirit and keeps it safe from thirsting Slaanesh. The final result of this transubstantiation can vary wildly.\\n\\nMost souls immediately lose all sense of identity, and meld with the forest. Some spirits wander the paths they walked in life, hidden from the gaze of all but the most magically attuned, carrying messages and warnings to those who can hear their words.\\n\\nOthers, driven by undying need to protect their woodland home, take root in deadwood hulks, animating the barren timbers into the battle-forms known as Tree Kin. Some Elves even believe that they have encountered loved ones reborn in the form of wild animals or as mischievous spite-creatures that flit between the boughs.\\n\\nSuch things might seem unlikely to outsiders, but there is little that is impossible beneath the eaves of Athel Loren.

In their truest form, these spirits appear as shining spheres of light or ghost-like auras. However, they can change form at will, and such is the array of shapes that they can take that it is almost impossible to categorise them.\\n\\nThey are known collectively as Spites, wilful and highly unpredictable beings, as likely to help a lost traveller out of the forest as to lead him to his doom. In times of peace they may take the forms of benevolent helpers and caretakers of Athel Loren, and appear friendly and harmless even if generally mischievous.\\n\\nThe Wood Elves often leave small offerings of food or shiny baubles for the Spites in an effort to distract them from mischief-making, although this is an almost impossible goal. They often associate themselves with a particular household or individual, and routinely steal food and coin, tie hair in knots and play practical jokes.\\n\\nHowever, Spites are swift to anger and easy to offend, and are quick to shift to more aggressive and vicious forms. Spites are present everywhere in Athel Loren, and often attach themselves to certain places, Elves or creatures.

To begin with, there was rivalry between these groups, for they were as defined as much by difference in ideology and tradition as they were by ties of blood. Eventually the influence of the forest saw the kindreds united in common cause.\\n\\nOver time, smaller kindreds – known as kinbands – arose as bloodlines combined and recombined, and as new traditions evolved from those that had been brought from Ulthuan. By the Season of Revelation, there were not only the twelve great kindreds whose lords and ladies ruled Athel Loren alongside Ariel and Orion, but also hundreds of lesser kinbands, each dedicated to a unique way of life.	false

No one can be sure if the Skaven Clanfleets venture southwards, but it seems likely that the mysterious lands of Araby and the Southlands are familiar and easier pickings for the Clanfleets. It is even harder to guess at the Skaven's desires and designs on these far-flung realms.\\n\\nThe Skaven Clanfleets are dangerous opponents not so much because of excellent ships or fine seamanship, but because of the sheer weight of numbers they employ. Skaven ships are crewed by hundreds of Clanrats, Slaves and Stormvermin, and their best ships carry Rat Ogres to add extra might. When boarding an enemy ship, a Skaven vessel is a fearsome opponent, as it is packed with a huge number of Ratmen, overwhelming and slaughtering their victims.\\n\\nA Skaven Clanfleet typically consists of many small fireships scurrying around the Great Bell of Doom sitting at the centre of the fleet.

In large ports like Marienburg, nearly everything moving in or out is taxed in some way.\\n\\nGiven this state of affairs, the Smugglers’ trade continues to thrive. While smuggling is, of course, illegal, most folks in the Empire don’t think much of cutting a few corners. In their minds, the taxmen and bureaucrats are the real thieves. Even the smugglers themselves think of their work as a moral service. After all, merchants and consumers can pay less for smuggled goods, and even the odd river-warden gets a cut…\\n\\nThere are a wide variety of smuggling jobs, from tiny, very expensive goods to large shipments of common staples. Some smugglers deal in illicit goods, a significantly riskier proposition if caught. However, regardless of the goods, any smuggling operation has the potential to go wrong. However, if a job goes smoothly, they can probably look forward to a bigger one. Even if they decide not to continue, a successful smuggler can find employment in many places.	false

The guards will search behind here, find it, and confiscate it. That's what we want because it means they don't find the twelve bottles we have hidden under here. And if they find those, all is not lost, because they will be so pleased with themselves they won't even bother searching over there where there's twenty-four bottles.”\\n\\nThe captain walked up and down the modified fishing boat, explaining where the various items are hidden to the assembled crew who, despite not having a working brain between them, were quite impressed. The captain was, of course, quite pleased with her little scheme, but then one of the one men in the crowd put his hand up.\\n\\nThe captain sighed. \\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Gibbs?”\\n\\n“Sorry to interrupt cap'n, but uh, won’t the crew arouse more suspicion since they are...” right at that moment, the arm of one of the deckhands fell off, causing the captain to remember that her crew were all effectively waterlogged corpses. “Yeah... I think we will need to find some 'warmer bodies' for this one.”\\n\\nThe Vampire sighed.\\n\\n“Mr. Gibbs, I've already got a few willing mortals on the payroll, so I suggest you stick to playing with cadavers, lest you want to end up as one, clear?”\\n\\nThe truth was that she didn't have a living crew lined up for this job (or really knew many mortals to begin with), but wasn't going to let her pet necromancer outsmart her... even if he did have a point.	false

gen_lore_cst_seaworthy_subtitle	Seaworthy	false
gen_lore_cst_seaworthy_description	Any self-respecting pirate needs a ship, but even then any smart captain will have preferences. The ideal pirate ship needs to be seaworthy, fast, and well-armed, as well as easy to careen and repair after a rough storm or battle. For this reason, most pirate ships are smaller sloops, brigs or galleys, with only the most successful pirate lords commanding larger galleons or carracks.\\n\\nHowever, not every pirate has the luxury of being able to choose their vessel, particularly for the seafaring undead. Ports that are friendly to pirates are rare, and rarer still are those willing to shelter or build ships for the undead. However, the undead realms of the Vampire Coast and Galleon’s Graveyard have plenty of shipwrecks, many of which can be repaired to sail again, even if the resulting vessels are held together with a combination of rotted wood, seaweed, barnacles and black magic.\\n\\nThe ship once known as “Fierté de la Dame”, for example, started its life as a Bretonnian Corsair: a swift, heavily-armed craft ideal for long sea voyages and deadly combat. Bretonnia’s ban on gunpowder did not apply to their navy, allowing the vessel to carry a complement of cannon. However, that was fifty years ago, before she ran aground on a reef in Lustria, ripping out the bottom, drowning the crew and half submerging the vessel.\\n\\nActually fixing the vessel required a great deal of work. The vessel had to be dragged out of the water and propped up on a makeshift scaffold, followed by months of painstaking repairs before she was even seaworthy. Even then, she’d never live up to the potential she once had, but to her new crew this mattered little, as the undead were not particularly picky.\\n\\n“Mr. Gibbs, what am I looking at?” \\n\\nOf course, the exception was their captains. Even vampires have standards, particularly if the hunk-o-wood they were travelling on was going to keep them dry or send them to a watery grave.\\n\\n“Your ship, master. Now, I know it might not look like much, but I assure you that the Dying-Gryphon is a fine ship!” responded the vampire’s pet necromancer, who could easily be mistaken for a corpse were he not so talkative.\\n\\n“Dying... Gryphon? For starters, you address me as either captain, mistress or ma’am; I’m not a Sylvanian for crying out loud! Secondly, who said you could name the ship?” The seafaring vampire had been stuck on land for months now, and the tropical heat was getting to her.\\n\\n“... I-I uh, just... do you have another name in mind?” the necromancer sputtered, silently praying that his first commission would not be his last.\\n\\nThe vampire stood silent for a minute before sighing.\\n\\n“I’ll allow the name, so long as it is seaworthy...”\\n\\nThe necromancer stood there silently. He’d actually had no idea if it was, since most of the patching was done by the carpenters that he resurrected.\\n\\n“That means launch it now!”\\n\\nThe necromancer quickly commanded the undead to launch the ship. Hammer-wielding deckhands knocked away the stocks preventing the ship from moving. As soon as they were removed the vessel slid down a makeshift slipway, stern-first into the bay. The necromancer held his breath... and thankfully the ship floated.\\n\\n“Oh, thank Manann,” he breathed with relief.\\n\\nThe vampire captain actually seemed surprised that it floated.\\n\\n“Huh, seems you get to live another day, Mr. Gibbs. Have the crew load the provisions and prepare to sail. I have business to take care of with the admiralty before we leave.”\\n\\n“Aye, aye, cap’n!”\\n\\nThen a question passed through the necromancer’s mind.\\n\\n“Actually cap’n, despite being with you for months I don’t actually know your name...”\\n\\nThe vampire would not dignify him with a response, instead walking off towards the admiral’s residence.\\n\\n“Okay, captain it is,” he sighed. “This is going to be long voyage...”	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislevite_navy_description	Kislev does not have a standing navy and, instead, the Kislevites rely on Empire warships and private merchant vessels to safeguard their waters. Pirates and privateers are a common sight in Kislevite ports, especially in Erengrad where even Norscan raiders can unload their ill-gotten gains on occasion. Of course, certain exceptions are made, but in general the freebooters are tolerated so long as they are raiding Kislev’s enemies.\\n\\nThe array of ships utilised by the pirates is astonishing: everything from Empire Wolfships and Sartosan Brigs to Kislev Lad’Ya and Norse longboats. Whilst not much use in a battle line, these ships are useful for raiding, as picket ships, and working in “wolf packs” they can even bring down mighty Norse Kingships, though they shouldn’t be expected to hold up against any serious opposition.\\n\\nThe waters of the Sea of Claws are dangerous, and all merchant ships are armed in some fashion, many to the standards of other nations’ warships, and can be pressed into service by the Tzarina when needed. Privately owned vessels capable of being part of a battle line are rare, although a few do exist, especially ships owned by wealthier merchants, such as carracks, galleons, greatships and galleass.\\n\\nGalleons in particular are quite well suited for line battles, being large multi-decked cargo ships built tall like castles to resist boarding actions, equipped with dozens of gunports filled with cannon forged in Nuln or Erengrad’s Cannoneers’ Compound. Some are equipped with armoured ramming prows for dealing with large icebergs as well as smaller Norscan raiding vessels. When pressed into service, more guns and better armed crews are added, along with a few... other aesthetic design choices (large domes and carved bears being common, courtesy of the Orthodoxy’s generous patronage).\\n\\nDue to the limited size and strength of the Kislev fleet when it is at war, the main fleet tends to stay close to their harbours and only leave their berths when raiding, protecting convoys or when the situation is dire. The general tactics that the fleet will use at sea are also quite conservative, aiming to take full advantage of their long range cannons for as long possible before any sort of melee action is taken.\\n\\nIf melee is inevitable, then the captains will make sure to take as many of the enemy with them to the bottom of the Sea of Claws. It is said that losses amongst Kislevite sailors during the last chaos invasion are said to be even worse than those suffered by the defenders of Praag, but losses amongst the Norseman were much, much worse.\\n	false

gen_lore_dwf_stubbornness_given_form_description	Dwarfs are shorter and stouter than Men, and are known for their broad shoulders, beards and stamina. The most defining characteristic of Dwarfs, however, is a gruff and stubborn nature. The Dwarfs' innate obstinacy is the stuff of legends and countless tales speak of both the great fortunes and the tragedies of this epic resolve.\\n\\nPositive accounts of the Dwarfs' tenacity speak of perseverance against all odds, a refusal to ever willingly accept defeat. Other sagas tell of dogged loyalty – of Dwarfs holding true to their word, honouring oaths despite vast dangers or the passage of centuries. It is this same fierce determination that drives Dwarf craftsmen to attain the pinnacles of engineering and architectural wonder that they realise through sweat and sheer perseverance.\\n\\nYet the adamancy of the Dwarfs has oft proven to be the very cause of their downfall. Indeed, their unforgiving nature has led the Dwarfs to fight horrific and bloody wars. By taking slight at the least provocation or by refusing to back down, the Dwarf race has lost countless allies, and begun untold battles in which they had little chance of surviving.\\n\\nEven in their unmatched feats of work, the belligerent streak of Dwarfs causes problems – their fabled intolerance of flaws means that upon perceiving the slightest defect, they will set about any amount of painstaking labour to rectify matters to their complete satisfaction. If this means wrecking all progress and starting over, then so be it.\\n	false

Most on each side fought with honour, yet during this long and brutal era, merciless deeds were also committed by both forces, although neither maintains any record that mentions any of their own acts of unflinching savagery, nor will either race ever admit that their side had anything to do with any such wrongdoings.\\n\\nIn their outrage, the Dwarfs chopped down entire virgin forests simply to spite the Elves. It was not enough for them to breach Elven fortresses and topple their elegant towers, as on more than one occasion the Dwarfs did not stop their war machine barrages until no two stones stood atop each other.\\n\\nFor their part, the Elves poisoned tarns and made pacts with unholy tree spirits in order to gain any battlefield advantage they could. When beset by entire armies of Dwarfs harnessed in mail impenetrable to their arrows, the Elves resorted to all manner of black-hearted trickery, feigned surrender and magical deception.	false

gen_lore_dwf_throne_of_power_description	It is said that the Throne of Power was made by Grungni himself and that as long as it endures, the Dwarf race will also. Since Snorri Whitebeard, the first High King after the Ancestor Gods departed, every High King in turn has sat upon the ancient wonder. In fact, tradition dictates that whenever the High King sits down, he must do so on the Throne of Power.\\n\\nAt Karaz-a-Karak, the Throne normally resides in the cavernous Great Hall, raised upon a massive pedestal of polished stone. Those who would seek an audience with the High King must climb a flight of steep steps as the Dwarf lord stares down imperiously.\\n\\nWhen the High King travels the Throne is borne aloft by four strapping Dwarfs who are called the Thronebearers. It is a great honour to be named a Thronebearer, for they are the High King's personal bodyguard.\\n\\nWhen the Dwarf High King goes to war, he does so riding atop the Throne of Power. From its sturdy deck, the High King can wield his axe to deadly effect while the bodyguards are adept at slashing attacks even while hefting the throne's considerable weight. Over the ages it has been at countless battles, seeing both great victories and crushing defeats.\\n\\nThere are many sagas of the kings of old, telling of the famous deeds done by those who fought upon it – from last stands to battle line-crushing breakthroughs. By some secret of its creation, the Throne is nearly impervious to harm, although it does bear slight dents in its ornate carvings caused down the ages by creatures such as Dragons or Greater Daemons.	false

gen_lore_dwf_underground_warfare_description	There are few things as brutal and bloody as the bitter fighting that goes on in the war beneath the world. Battles take place in cramped corridors and cavernous halls, with foes emerging unexpectedly from new tunnels opened up to allow the enemy to attack suddenly from almost any direction. In such close quarters butchery there is no mercy, and a single step backwards can quickly turn into slaughter and rout.\\n\\nDwarfs naturally excel at subterranean warfare, their sturdy compact physique, thick, impenetrable armour and determined tenacity makes them nearly impossible to shift out of a narrow confine. Behind locked shields the doughty warriors push forwards, axes at the ready for a grinding battle of attrition, the kind of fight they have nearly always emerged victorious from since the dawn of time.\\n\\nBut it is rare when an underground battle can be won by simply slogging it out, as other armies too have become adept at such warfare. Skaven and Night Goblins in particular have evolved many underhanded tactics, loathsome beasts and diabolical engines of war in an attempt to counter the superior troops of the Dwarfs.	false

gen_lore_dwf_coming_of_chaos_description	According to the account in the Great Book of Grudges, the most ancient Dwarf book of lore, the coming of Chaos rent the earth and sky and tore the very mountains apart. Turbulent winds of multicoloured magic clouded the air. The Dwarfs maintain that Grungni warned his people that such a time might come, and he told them to take refuge deep beneath the mountains. There, they sheltered as the Winds of Magic erupted out of the north and scoured the world.\\n\\nWhen the tempest passed, it left in its wake a layer of dust that hastened corruption. When the Dwarfs emerged from their underground dwellings, they found the world a very changed place. Mutated beasts and rage-filled monstrosities prowled the mountains, but there was something even worse. During the great storm, Daemons had burst forth from the Realm of Chaos, and now they stalked the lands, seeking to slay all they found. It was not long before the mountain strongholds of the Dwarfs were ferociously assailed.\\n\\nThe Daemons quickly found out that the Dwarfs were far from defenceless. Ancient tales tell how Grungni taught his people to inscribe magical runes onto their weapons and armour – allowing them to stand against the creatures of Chaos that assaulted them. Valaya used her protections to ward off the dark magic of their enemies, dampening their dread powers.\\n\\nIt was Grimnir, equipped with two mighty axes and armour harder than the mountains themselves, who launched the counter-attack. With their blazing warrior god at the fore, the Dwarfs clove a path up and down the mountain range, killing so many of their foe that, for a time, the Worlds Edge Mountains were clear of Daemons. Grimnir himself pressed the attack, pursuing his enemy with a relentless fury that dimmed only when the last foe was slain.	false

gen_lore_dwf_first_contact_description	It was at the height of the Great Catastrophe that the Dwarfs first made contact with the Elves. A fleet of Elven warships, captained by Caledor Dragontamer, had been blown off course after a sea battle with a Chaos fleet. Caledor was a great mage, and he searched the coasts of the Old World, hoping to find clues to the source of the Chaos that was destroying the world. Instead, Caledor encountered a Dwarf army led by Grimnir himself, for they had pursued the remnants of a Daemon army and sought to slay the last of them.\\n\\nIt was a pivotal moment in history, as one of the greatest and most subtle High Elf mages of all time met the brutal and mighty incarnate warrior god of the Dwarfs. What Grimnir made of the tall and haughty Elf mage is not recorded, nor is what Caledor thought of the tattooed Dwarf warlord. Both realised that they were not enemies, and the matter was settled when a force of Beastmen attacked. After a hastily agreed alliance, the foe was shattered by the combined might of Grimnir's axes and Caledor's spells.\\n\\nFrom Caledor, the Dwarfs learned of the great Phoenix King and his struggle to free the distant island of Ulthuan from the grip of Chaos. From Grimnir, Caledor learned of the storm that burst from the north that had preceded the Daemons. The wise mage concluded that a Chaos gate had opened in the utmost north, a doorway between their world and the unimaginable Realm of Chaos.\\n\\nWith this information, and their newly formed alliance, Caledor departed, in all likelihood already formulating the plan that would lead to the creation of a mighty vortex to suck the unleashed Chaos power out of the world. Upon Caledor's departure, Grimnir presented him with a runic amulet of sovereign protective power. In return, Caledor gifted the Dwarf with the Crystal of Fire, an artefact that is kept, to this day, in the Great Vault of Karaz-a-Karak.	false

gen_lore_dwf_doom_of_grimnir_description	The respite won by Grimnir and his armies was hard-won, but its duration was brief. Even as Grimnir headed back to the mountains, the skies grew ominous. Once more, the tide of Chaos rolled over the lands, the Daemon legions and their untold horrors destroying everything in their path.\\n\\nThis time, the Daemons attacked in such great numbers that the heroism of Grimnir was not enough, and the Dwarfs were pressed backwards. Unable to hold their ground, the Dwarfs were eventually forced to retreat inside their strongholds. One by one, their mountain fortresses were besieged.\\n\\nAlthough they fought valiantly against the tide of Chaos, several holds fell to the unholy onslaught. Having heard Caledor's theory of a Chaos gate, Grimnir decided to take action. Ignoring advice, he resolved to trek north and close the gate himself. Grungni told him he would surely die, but Grimnir snarled that it was worth the risk.\\n\\nThe great warrior god ritually shaved his head, save for a single defiant crest. He gave one of his axes to his eldest son, Morgrim, and departed for the north. A party of Dwarfs, led by Morgrim, accompanied Grimnir to the edge of the wastes that lay to the north, fighting off many dangers just to reach this region. There, they at last turned back, watching in awe as Grimnir pressed onwards, his form dwindling into the shimmering haze of that poisoned land.\\n\\nGrimnir was never seen again, and no one knows what befell this most valiant of Dwarfs. Perhaps he was, at last, pulled down by an army of monsters. One tale affirms he fought his way to the mouth of the Chaos gate and held it against an army of Daemons even as Caledor completed his spell on Ulthuan. Perhaps an even stranger and more terrible doom overtook him? Of Grimnir's fate, the Dwarfs do not speak, saying only that he fell in darkness long ago.	false

gen_lore_dwf_golden_age_description	In the end, Caledor's spell drained the rampant magic from the lands, an act that banished the Daemons to the shadowy corners of the world. In an instant, the armies of unnatural creatures that surrounded each stronghold disappeared, and the Dwarfs emerged into the dawning of a whole new era.\\n\\nThe Dwarf gods were gone; Grungni, Valaya and the lesser deities had disappeared. It is popularly believed that they returned to the mountains' heart, going back from whence they came to emerge again some day when their people most need them. In the Worlds Edge Mountains, the Dwarfs prospered greatly, but of their kin in the north or from the Mountains of Mourn, they had no word.\\n\\nDuring this age, the strongholds were deepened, expanding into vast underground cities connected by subterranean highways. The Elves returned to the Old World to establish colonies, and the Dwarfs eagerly traded with them. A long age of peace and prosperity was begun. In Karaz-a-Karak the High King sat upon his carved throne and presided over the Dwarf lords who ruled the other strongholds.

This hard-won situation should have ensured Dwarfen dominion over the Old World for ages to come; however, the fates proved unkind.\\n\\nThe long conflict had bled their empire white, and the Dwarfs found their vigour expended. Before they had even begun to recover, their realm was beset by natural disasters that unleashed destruction unparalleled since the coming of Chaos. The unquestionable end of the Golden Age came amid a devastating series of earthquakes that shook the length of the Worlds Edge Mountains. These, in turn, were soon followed by volcanic eruptions of monumental proportions. \\n\\nDuring the War of Vengeance, the Elves had launched several attempts to batter the great Karaks of the Dwarfs, but their feeble siegecraft had never seriously damaged any of the mountain strongholds. Yet what centuries of warfare had failed to do, the earthquakes achieved in mere moments.\\n\\nEvery single settlement of the Dwarfs suffered calamity, as walls collapsed, mine workings were shattered and lower levels were flooded by subterranean rivers. The mountains themselves shuddered, in some cases breaking apart to send avalanches in sweeping waves that crushed everything in the valleys below. Lava poured into cavernous vaults, and the whole of the Everlasting Realm was thrown into disarray.\\n\\nAs devastating as the earthquakes were, other menaces were lurking in wait, sinister forces that had been multiplying in secret while the attention of the Dwarfs was elsewhere. The attacks began before the last of the aftershocks had finished. Enemies infiltrated through unguarded tunnels, overwhelmed outposts with surprise attacks and swept out of darksome valley forests in numbers untold.\\n\\nPreviously, the mountain fortresses of the Dwarfs had proven impervious, regardless of an invader’s numbers, but that was no longer the case. Defensive walls had been toppled and lower levels hopelessly compromised by innumerable pits and gaping chasms. Routes into the mountain kingdom now lay unguarded, as the former bastions carved into the rock face were but piles of broken stones. Rune-covered gates that could withstand the titanic blows of a Giant now hung off their hinges or lay split in twain.

gen_lore_dwf_dawn_of_a_new_age_description	It was a strange quirk of fate that bonded the race of Dwarfs more closely to that of Men. A trading convoy that included the High King, Kurgan Ironbeard, was ambushed on its way from Karaz-a-Karak to the Grey Mountains. The Orc army that attacked them was immense, and although the Dwarfs slew their foes until Greenskins lay in piled heaps, they could not prevent the Orcs from capturing High King Kurgan.\\n\\nLuckily for the beleaguered Dwarfs, this territory was the domain of the Unberogens, a fierce and warlike tribe of Men who fought relentlessly to clear their lands of Greenskins. Led by Sigmar, the chieftain's son, the Unberogens fell upon the Orc army with fury. By annihilating their foe, the tribesmen freed the Dwarf High King, an act that instantly put the Dwarfs deep in debt to their newfound allies — and it is a point of pride to Dwarfs that they never forget a debt.\\n\\nAs a token of the bond of friendship, the Dwarfs gifted Sigmar with the mighty runic warhammer, Ghal Maraz, which meant “Skull Splitter” in the harsh language of the Dwarfs. Together, the Dwarfs and the warriors of Sigmar's tribe began a long campaign that drove the Greenskins from the lands in droves and culminated in the mighty Battle of Black Fire Pass.\\n\\nA new age of prosperity had begun. Many Dwarfs moved into the newly forming Empire, and trade between the lowlands and the mountains flourished. Although their numbers had lessened, there were still Greenskins, Beastmen and monsters, and Men needed weapons to fight them. Even better, the humans would pay good gold for every sword the Dwarfs forged.\\n\\nWith the western lands stabilising and Black Fire Pass now closed to enemies, the Dwarfs attempted to re-establish a grip upon the Worlds Edge Mountains. Throng after throng marched forth from the great holds. Tenaciously, they cleared Orc encampments off the mountainsides, scoured tunnels of Night Goblins, exterminated Skaven dens and drove monsters out of bone-strewn lairs.\\n\\nBut the toll was high, as every step, cavern, tunnel and mountain pass was paid for with Dwarf blood. Yet the Dwarfs would never rest, never let an axe blade grow dull while there was yet a grudge unstruck in the Great Book of Grudges or while an ancestor's tomb still lay despoiled and dishonoured.	false

Although the Dwarfs were still master craftsmen, and as unparalleled as their skills were when compared to other races, they could not duplicate the feats of their forefathers. Runesmiths could still capture magic within metal, making unrivalled arms and armour – but even their best works could not match the sheer power and might bound within the great artefacts forged in elder days. In one aspect alone did the Dwarfs outstrip their ancestors: engineering.\\n\\nInventions flourished in the Silver Age, but Dwarfs are a conservative folk, and it takes them time to accept new ideas. Thus, an item's invention can be many generations removed from when it actually becomes acceptable to use it. To this day, some clans still don't welcome “new-fangled contraptions”. Nevertheless, great progress in engineering occurred during this age.\\n\\nBlack powder weapons were devised, and continual improvements were wrought upon cog-driven devices, water-wheel technology and engines of various types. Mining was revolutionised by steam-powered drilling and now it took fewer Dwarfs to excavate a new mine.

The sprawling underground complexes are made up of halls (those levels at or above the main gate's level), wide avenues and deeps (those levels below the main gate).

Grunni took his place in line in time to see the first wave emerge out of the darkness. It was his worst nightmare – a tide of gaunt feral bodies flowing down the hallway.\\n\\n“Steady,” growled a voice Grunni recognised as that of Korzak, their leader. Not until Grunni could see the red beady eyes and worm-like tails of his foe did Korzak give the order to light fuses. With hands shaking, it took three flint-strikes before Grunni's fuse caught, and when he looked up the Skaven were within spitting distance. Only then did the old Prospector bark the order for the regiment to throw their blasting charges.\\n\\nThunderclap explosions rocked the tunnel. Smoke and the acrid stink of black powder filled the halls and afterwards Grunni could hear only ringing. The first wave of ratmen was blown to bits, but more stepped over the mangled remains. Grunni met the Skaven advance with his pickaxe, swinging until his arms felt like he'd excavated a motherlode.\\n\\nBut the Skaven kept coming, driving Grunni and his fellow Miners back to a low rubble wall from which protruded a barrel.

Most, such as the alcohol vapour engine, come to a bad end, but a few are begrudgingly accepted. The tension between creation and tradition has caused many visionaries to be expelled from the guild, which has a number of traditional (and highly embarrassing) rites of expulsion.\\n\\nSome win re-admittance if their invention later wins acceptance, although typically, acknowledgment occurs long after its creator's death. For some few Engineers, the fierce derision and exile becomes the anvil upon which many fantastical inventions are forged.	false

gen_lore_dwf_dwarf_names_subtitle	Dwarf Names	false
gen_lore_dwf_dwarf_names_description	Dwarfs take great stock in names, each clan and hold keeping long and detailed lists documenting those who live therein. Although there are exceptions, Dwarf names typically follow one of two specific patterns. The first is based on the parent's name (usually the father's) by adding “sson” or “sdottir” to the end of the parent's name.\\n\\nFamous examples include Morgrimsson, the son of former High King Morgrim Blackbeard, or Burloksson, the son of Burlok Damminsson (himself the son of Dammin). The second method is a title describing an especially dominating feature, such as physical appearance, strength, martial ability, talent, skill, profession or demeanour. Examples of this would be Thorgrim Grudgebearer or Helgar Long-Plaits.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for Dwarfs, over their long lives, to acquire a string of several names. They will begin with a given name, such as Thorg or Balric. This is often followed by the clan he belongs to: so, Thorg of Clan Stonehelm, and perhaps a title earned by deed or characteristic, like Shieldsplitter or Forkbeard.\\n\\nFinally there can be titles or ranks for his clan, guild or duty, such as Thane, Master, or Captain of the Second Deep. So, in full, you might have: Thane Thorg Shieldsplitter of Clan Stonehelm. Outside of formal occasions, any of these could be dropped for convenience.	false

gen_lore_dwf_dwarf_ales_description	Dwarfs are inordinately fond of ale, which they brew and drink in vast quantities. Dwarf ale is so nourishing that it is possible to survive on it alone for weeks on end. Every stronghold has a store of barrels and takes pride in the unique flavour of its brews.\\n\\nWars between clans have been started by the mere suggestion that a hold's ale tastes remotely similar to mannish brews (considered watery). After the length of his beard, the mark of any Dwarf is the amount he can guzzle, a feat warriors feel improves their battle prowess.	false

gen_lore_dwf_death_before_dishonour_description	Filled with pride, Snorri watched the fog roll back from the mountain pass. This would be his first time standing shoulder to shoulder with his clan, an honour he had waited for his whole life.\\n\\nThe first of the hunched creatures appeared out of the gloom and Snorri felt his deep-seated hatred growing. Then a sudden gust of wind cleared the valley and the full scale of the Greenskin horde was revealed. There were thousands of them! Snorri's hands grew clammy, his knees weak.\\n\\nThroat-clearing splutters broke the stillness, as Longbeards – the most veteran warriors – took their place in the throng's battle line. Soon, gruff voices began shouting, loudly condemning their foe.\\n\\n“Look at 'em. Not nearly enough, are there?”\\n\\n“I've seen bigger tusks on cave-squirrels. This better be worth puttin' me mail on for.”\\n\\n“You there, beardling — keep your shield high!”\\n\\nSnorri was sure that last comment was directed towards him, although he was positive his shield was perfectly positioned. He knew the veterans would complain about anything. Fear forgotten, Snorri swore a silent oath that he would not give them any reason to grumble.	false

gen_lore_dwf_slayers_of_legend_description	Slayers regularly attempt impossible deeds, pitting their axes and finely tuned killing skills against creatures that outclass them in terms of power and size by a hundredfold or more. Undaunted by hopeless odds or how many of their own kind fall, Slayers do not stop their attack until they are dead.\\n\\nNo matter how large, if enough Slayers are present, even the most titanic foe will eventually be hacked down and slain. From out of such fierce tenacity legends have grown – tales of Slayers performing deeds of unbelievable might.\\n\\nBrakuk One-eye waded through an entire Skaven army before splitting a grey rat-wizard and his infernal bell device in two, while Hugnir, out of Karaz-a-Karak, single-handedly slew a dozen Giants. Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King, smote down the Dragon of Black Peak, a beast that, by itself, had routed armies and devoured entire towns in the Empire.\\n\\nYet of all their many impressive glories, there are no Slayers that can match the bloodstained feats of Gotrek Gurnisson. Armed with a battleaxe that rivals the one borne by High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer in craftsmanship, it is said that Gotrek fights with the skill and fury of Grimnir himself.\\n\\nOver the course of his death quest, which has been recorded by the human rememberer known as Felix Jaeger, Gotrek has carved his way through all manner of the most deadly creatures in the world, dispatching enemy warlords, vile seers, ancient Vampire Lords, Greater Daemons, and Dragons all with the same contemptuous ease.	false

gen_lore_dwf_runic_might_subtitle	Runic Might	false
gen_lore_dwf_runic_might_description	The earliest of Runesmiths were the most potent at capturing mighty enchantments with their work, for they learned their hammercraft from the Ancestor Gods or the ensuing masters that emerged from those initial teachings. As they do not write down lore and would rather die than pass along secrets to an unworthy successor, each time a Runelord falls in battle, irreplaceable knowledge is lost.\\n\\nLiving Runesmiths reckon that fewer than half of the magic runes created are still in use today, as the skills to replicate them are no longer known. Runesmiths constantly search for lost runes. Any Dwarf-made artifact of antiquity is examined, not only to marvel at its expert craftwork, but also to seek for hidden signs.\\n\\nIn some cases, runes fade over thousands of years as their magic gradually leaks away, although this does not happen with master-forged items. Many runes are visible only to another Runesmith, who can re-activate their power. But replicating secrets from the golden age is difficult, for it is not enough to copy the rune – the proper ritual must be observed in full.\\n\\nTo strike a rune of power a Runesmith must know what chanted verses will imbue the forge fires with sufficient heat, how many times to hammer the molten metals, as well as correct tempering agents. The Master Rune of Swiftness must be slaked in quicksilver and to apply the Master Rune of Gromril requires purest metals and months of non-stop hammering in exact rhythm – missing a single strike can diffuse power.\\n\\nA Runesmith who knows all a ritual save a single element can still spend the rest of his considerable lifespan experimenting hopelessly seeking to complete it. Given time, the best Runesmiths intuitively feel stone and steel, and can eventually work out the correct course of action, be it tempering the red-hot metal in Troll's blood, or a series of sonorous chants between clanging hammer blows.	false

Brogar braced himself, feeling a teeth-rattling jolt of impact as the strike bounced off his armour. He instinctively closed his eyes, yet still registered the flash as the runes on his mail flared brightly.\\n\\nBrogar silently thanked the Ancestor Gods for their protection. He knew his gromril suit had absorbed the blow just as he knew, without needing to check, that the ancient armour of his forefathers would not even be dented.\\n\\n“By Grungni's Sacred Hammer, is that all you've got?” Brogar grunted, as he hefted his axe overhead and brought it down with all his might. The Northman was too quick and shifted his towering shield to catch the blow. It was done with the deft ease of someone who had performed such a manoeuvre untold times in hundreds of battles.\\n\\nBrogar felt a surge of pride, for no shield would stop his runic axe, the heirloom Dreng Borax – “the Promise of Death”. Brogar felt shivers run down his arms as his axeblow clove through his foe's shield, split his breastplate, and bit deep into flesh and bone.\\n\\nWith a metallic shriek, Brogar tugged Dreng Borax free from the bloody ruin, letting the corpse crumple to the ground. As the runes on his axe blazed in incandescent fury, Brogar barked out his challenge: “Alright, who's next?”	false

gen_lore_dwf_veneration_craft_description	All Dwarfs have great pride in their craft, stoically taking immense pleasure in well-constructed things that are built to last. By contrast, the Dwarf word for “shoddiness” can also translate as man-made – a damning criticism of the short-sighted human propensity to craft ephemeral items.\\n\\nTo Dwarfs, the preservation and continuing use of a device is a form of respect and veneration for its creator. Thus, marvelling at the awe-inspiring craft that carved the magnificent pillars within a Dwarfhold can be likened to a form of worship. After all, by doing so, they are paying tribute to the Ancestor Gods who first gave rise to the race of Dwarfs.\\n\\nWorks from the days when Grungni, Grimnir, Valaya and the lesser pantheon walked amongst their people are treasured beyond all other riches, but precious few remain, and rarer still are those items directly associated with the Ancestor Gods themselves. Dwarfs will travel thousands of miles to visit a destination where such things reside – such as the Shrine of Grimnir at Karak Kadrin, or the Stone of Grungni standing along the Silver Road.\\n\\nDwarfs, Runesmiths in particular, still seek to locate the missing items of their legends, such as the famous Hammer of Grungni, or the rune-covered Dolmens of the Gods – the fabled portals from which the Ancestor Gods first stepped from out of the living mountains and, it is said, from which they will one day return.	false

gen_lore_dwf_clan_hierarchy_description	Not all clans are considered equal. The lowest ranks in Dwarf society are those clans that have been disgraced, such as Clan Growlsh, infamous drinkers who failed in their oath to protect then High King Alrik Deathdealer's daughter. Outcasts are unwelcome in any hold and must make their own way. Some persevere in the wilderness, living rugged lives as prospectors or rangers, others leave the mountains to work in human realms, but most perish, overcome by ancient foes before they can restore their honour.\\n\\nRanked above outcasts are wanderers – clans that have lost their homes and have yet to settle, or have only recently arrived to a hold. Such clans' reputations are not besmirched, but without roots, they are regarded as untrustworthy.\\n\\nThe majority of Dwarf clans are respectable and live in or near well-established holds. Higher up in the hierarchy are those clans that show a mastery at a craft or are extremely rich. At the apex of a hold are clans with royal ties – the nobility of the Dwarfs, the highest of which is the king of the hold and his family.\\n\\nThe greatest of the kings can trace their lines unbroken to the Ancestor Gods – and it is from these clans that the High King is chosen. Only if a royal line is extinguished (or disgraced) will it change. In such an event, a relative from the same clan might be invited to claim kingship or a thane from a related high-ranking clan might be raised to establish a new line of lords. The exact action is decided in council by the thanes of the hold, and is subject to wrangling from the guilds and the most influential of clans.	false

gen_lore_dwf_guilds_subtitle	Guilds	false
gen_lore_dwf_guilds_description	Dwarfs are possessive, and to help guard the secrecy of their most skilled crafts, the Dwarfs have created guilds – artisan clans that trace their ancestry to a single master of old. Thus, to be born into the Clan of Morgrim, better known as the Runesmiths Guild, is to be destined, in some fashion, to be involved in the arcane study of working metal and magic into mighty runes of power.\\n\\nAll guilds follow the path of apprentice, journeyman and master, with a council of the guild's masters responsible for enforcing the strict rules. This keeps skills within a clan, although as their talents are in high demand, guild members tend to be thinly spread across many strongholds.\\n\\nEach guild has all manner of secret handshakes and unusual rituals that allow them to identify other members that they have never met before. These guilds form a small, but authoritative faction in Dwarf society.	false

gen_lore_dwf_gates_of_karaz_a_karak_description	Karaz-a-Karak, translated into the Human tongue, roughly means “the Pinnacle of the Mountains”. It is the largest of the Dwarf strongholds and is one of the most magnificent pieces of architecture in the world. Hidden from view by a winding pass that cuts its way through the Worlds Edge Mountains, as you round yet another outcrop on your long trek through the steep treacherous pass the full splendour of the gates of Karaz-a-Karak suddenly looms before you.\\n\\nThe sheer size of the gates will take your breath away. Standing at over four hundred feet tall, the gates appear to be carved into the mountainside. A solid flat bastion of stone reaches up to embrace the clouds and if you turn your head towards the sky you can just make out the glint of a multitude of armoured figures patrolling the upper wall. Carved into the gate is the symbol of Valaya, the Dwarf ancestor-goddess. Her image on the gates is said to protect the city from harm and evil magics.\\n\\nNo visitor ever approaches Karaz-a-Karak unannounced. Miles before even a lone traveller reaches the gates his progress will have been spied by the many hidden watchposts that overlook the Everpeak pass. A lone Dwarf in full clan regalia will await you on your arrival. He bears the title of Gatekeeper and it is to him and him alone that you must state your business.\\n\\nFew these days are allowed access to the great Dwarf city. Once, the gates stood open to all visitors and the Dwarf race was more than welcoming to strangers in their realm. Years of war and devastation have changed that forever and now they do not encourage contact with other races.\\n\\nShould a visitor have good reason, and very good reason only, to enter the kingdom of Karaz-a-Karak, the gatekeeper will knock rhythmically on the door five times with his intricately carved rune hammer, then trace the sign of a secret rune into its flat surface. Silvery seams once invisible to even the closest inspection of the smooth granite surface suddenly appear. Seemingly from out of nowhere a doorway no more than four foot high and three foot wide opens.	false

gen_lore_dwf_the_unbreakable_description	It has been many centuries since the High King gave instruction to a Gatekeeper to open the main gates. In the year following the terrible earthquake that shook many of the Dwarf realms to their very foundations, Morgrim Ironbeard, the High King of the time, ordered the gates to be closed. This dour period of Dwarf history is known as the Time of Woes.\\n\\nMany of the Dwarf strongholds were under attack from hordes of Greenskins and Skaven that flooded out from the caverns to take advantage of the devastation that the earthquake had unleashed on the Dwarfs. In his wisdom the King shut off access to the great city. In doing so he also shut off the Dwarfs from contact with the outside world, and it has remained much this way to the current day.\\n\\nThe gates are only opened to allow the High Kings army to march to war. In the rare event that this happens, the gates are opened in silence with no ceremony. Dwarfs do not celebrate war and a Dwarf army on the march from Karaz-a-Karak, whilst a sight to behold, is a solemn affair.\\n\\nThe gates of the city have only ever been besieged twice in its long history and both times the besiegers have been forced to abandon their attempts. Even the largest of the great war machines that the Orc Warlord Ugrok Beard Burner brought to bear on the gate barely caused an indentation into the thick stone. The Orc Warlord himself realised the futility of trying to break down the gate with the giant battering ram he had constructed, and the Dwarfs sallied forth and destroyed his horde as he lifted the siege.\\n\\nIt is said that amongst the defences of the city great rivers of molten lava can be poured from the mouths of the carved stone dragons that sit atop the upper wall of the gate. Also, it is claimed that the hills around the approach to the gates are filled with powerful steam engines, which can cause avalanches and rockslides, and even drop lengths of the path into hidden chasms and crevasses.\\n\\nAll Dwarfs hold hope in their hearts that one day the giant gate of the great stronghold will open once more, and that fine Dwarf craftsmanship will once again be available to trade across the world. Until that day the Dwarfs continue to remain safely protected from the outside world, behind the stone fortress that protects their city.	false

A warrior at the young age of one hundred, I was proud to be fighting with the High King and his kin. Those were the days, when Goblins were real Goblins, not like the skinny green wretches you get nowadays.”\\n\\nRedmane pulled a pipe from his pocket, handing it to one of his audience to fill.\\n\\n“Now as I was saying, before the High King was treacherously pulled to his sad demise over the icy falls, I was lucky enough to meet a Slayer bearing the name of Garaith Ungrim. It was from him that I learned of the tale of the very first Slayer; Gudrun was his name, and he was best friend to King Skorri Morgrimson. The pair had grown up together as beardlings and fought side by side in many a battle.”\\n\\n“That having been said, you can imagine the honour that he felt when the King asked him to protect his only son Furgil as he attempted to infiltrate the lower halls of Karak Ungor. Swearing an oath to his King, Gudrun followed Furgil on his mission. When the party was ambushed by a band of Night Goblins accompanied by a huge Troll, Gudrun fought valiantly to save his Prince's life. It is said that over sixty of the vile Grobi lay at his feet but still they came, until a lucky blow struck Gudrun unconscious. As blackness enveloped his eyes, he saw Furgil being carried away by a Troll.”\\n\\nThe small crowd that had gathered around Durgrim sat in silence enraptured by his tale.\\n\\n“When he awoke he found himself alone, the Goblins had left him for dead although they had stolen his hammer and even robbed the very boots from his feet. Gudrun tracked the Troll, treading barefoot down through the dark depths of Karak Ungor until he found its lair. Upon discovering the slain mutilated body of the Dwarf prince, such was Gudrun's rage that he took the dead prince's rune-axe and beheaded the vile Troll with a single blow.”\\n\\n“Gudrun's shame upon failing to protect his ward was so deep that he knew he could never return to Karaz-a-Karak and face the King. Now before his murder, Prince Furgil sported a deep fiery red beard that was the envy of every Dwarf this side of the Worlds Edge Mountains. In his grief Gudrun dyed his own hair orange in respect to the fallen prince.”\\n\\n“Unable to fulfil his oath to his King, Gudrun wandered the mountains. Seeking death as a release from his sorrow, he spent the remainder of his years hunting down and slaying every Troll that he could find. To this day, Dwarfs unable to fulfil an oath still dye their hair bright orange and wield an axe in respect of Gudrun and Furgil. As for Gudrun, no one knows of his fate, but none shall forget his name.”\\n\\nOld Redman sucked on the large pipe which had been filled and lit for him.\\n\\n“Call this pipeweed!” He coughed out a great billow of musky smelling smoke.\\n\\n“I’ve smoked hay that tasted better.”	false

In the olden days, our ancestors realised the perils of dabbling with the forces of magic in its raw form, and they knew best. Runes they made, powerful runes to capture the magic, not let it float about all willy-nilly where it could do no end of harm. Everything had runes on in them days, not like now where they're something rare and special. Even had me a rune-lamp once, and a rune-cloak, but now there isn't the Runesmith who can make 'em.”\\n\\nThe old Hammerer prised the top off the beer keg and dipped his drinking horn into the foamy, lumpy liquid within.\\n\\n“The Runesmiths you see, they's a rare breed now, and getting rarer. And the magic, that's going too. Only the Runelords, the venerable ones with a good five hundred years under their belt, only they can try to make really powerful runes these days. Was a time when an apprentice would be forging them types of runes, but not nowadays.”\\n\\n“I remember great-great-great-uncle Snaddri had a rune-axe that could take the top off a mountain if he had a mind to do it, which he didn't 'cause attacking mountains is something only a daft Manling would do. Still, them Runelords have got their Anvils of Doom, keep them in good shape still.

You practising to be a Ranger, lad?” he asked the owner, who nodded slightly, unsure whether this would meet with the old Dwarf's approval or not.\\n\\n“Something odd about a Dwarf who likes being up on the surface all day, hunting and such. In the olden days we wouldn't have gone above ground for more than an hour unless we had to. All that sun and air's bad for your health you know, and there's plenty a Ranger gone missing never to return.

Who am I to say?”\\n\\nThe would-be Ranger shrugged and made a half-hearted attempt to retrieve his crossbow, but it was drawn just out of reach as Redmane turned towards the bar.\\n\\n“In the old days, we didn't need Rangers to tell us what was happening. We'd have messengers running along the Underway from Hold to Hold, telling folks what was going on, if the Orcs was on the move or whatever. Sneaking about in the rocks and woods, spying and watching, that sounds like something an Elf would do, no offence to you lad.

Just good honest stone and metal, that's a miner's work.

Unlike many of the younger Dwarfs who were currently collapsed asleep on the tables, he was showing little if any sign of intoxication. His red, bulbous nose was a clear indicator that he was a seasoned veteran to drink.\\n\\n“Back when I were a lad, any elder recounting tales of the past would have filled this bar twice over with people, all eager to hear his words of wisdom to pass down to their children.”\\n\\nDurgrim took the freshly filled tankard off the barman, thanking him politely.\\n\\n“Still, what with all those newfangled contraptions such as the likes of Gyrocannons and Flamecopters it's hardly surprising that your generation has the attention span of a Troll. I remember my great grandfather telling me about the day the Engineers discovered blackpowder.”\\n\\n“Now, I'm not one to belittle the Engineers Guild, even if they are a bunch of dangerously insane lunatics, but there are Dwarfs amongst them that'll have you believe that the invention of blackpowder was quite intentional.”\\n\\nDurgrim chuckled to himself.\\n\\n“You try telling that to the poor Dwarfs who found themselves blown straight up to the cavern roof. It took them days to clear up the mess. There's still a dent or two in the ceiling so they say.”\\n \\nA few of the crowd that had gathered burst out in laughter.\\n\\n“Still, for all their bumbling about they certainly know how to make good cannons. You'll rarely see a Dwarf cannon blow up, not like those shoddy, cheap, oversized pop guns that the men of the Empire are so proud of. Great Cannon, hah!” Durgrim spat his contempt.\\n\\n“The only thing great 'bout them is that 'twere a Dwarf who invented 'em. Dwarf cannons are built to last. We won't even consider taking one to battle unless it's over five hundred years old. Unless the Engineer who built it has a beard down past his boots the cannon ain't worth the iron it's forged from.”\\n\\n“You see, an Engineer has to be that old to be able to help the Runesmith inscribe the correct runes.

gen_lore_dwf_defence_hold_description	Although the Dwarfs are a martial race, skilled in all the arts of war, there are few professional Dwarf soldiers. The majority of Dwarfs are craftsmen and artisans who, when called upon by their clan leader, will organise into regiments to fight for king and hold.\\n\\nWithin each clan, the Longbeards form a core of professional warriors, and instruct the others, often while in a tavern. In return, they are released from their more mundane duties to practice their skills. Similarly, the hold's Hammerers form the king's permanent bodyguard and have special responsibilities for guarding the gates of the hold. Ironbreaker regiments are charged with guarding the underground approaches and, like the Hammerers, are perpetually under arms.\\n\\nBecause only a fraction of the available Warriors are on duty at any time, the Dwarfs depend on getting early warning of attacks. Around each hold is a network of fortifications ranging from squat bastions to observation posts on the high peaks, many connected by tunnels both to each other and the hold itself.\\n\\nAs an enemy approaches they will find themselves under fire from war machines placed in the bastions, delaying and disrupting their advance. The legendary ingenuity of the Dwarfs is manifest in the variety and sophistication of the outer defences. Finally, the invader will be confronted with the readied defences of the hold itself, which are impervious to anything other than a long siege.\\n\\nDepending on the circumstances, the king may choose to take the battle to the invaders, perhaps emerging with his mustered throng from hidden gates to strike by surprise. A quick victory is always preferable. The longer the throng is at war, the poorer the hold gets so it suits all concerned to settle things as quickly as is prudent to ensure that the mines and workshops can return to normal. Sometimes a half-throng or quarter-throng will be called. Here only a proportion of each clan's strength is mustered, allowing a longer campaign, knowing that the hold is secure and prosperous.	false

gen_lore_dwf_bugmans_gift_description	The campfire was burning low. Bjarni threw some more wood on it and squatted back down. He did not know the other Dwarfs around the fire as they had come into camp after dark. Bjarni had caught the whiff of ale though, and had brought a couple of burning brands across to get their fire going and be sociable.\\n\\nThey were a tight-lipped lot and in the flickering light Bjarni had seen more battle scars and killer's eyes than he had his whole life. He had just about decided to wander off back to his kinsmen when the stranger to his right passed a heavy tankard to him and rumbled,\\n\\n“Drink, lad. Drink to the past and drink to the morrow's reckoning.”\\n\\nThe tankard felt cool in his hand, too heavy for pewter. He could feel the relief-work on it and knew it to be of fine make. Lifting it to his lips he sniffed the heavy aroma of traditional Dwarf ale. It slid down smoothly though, and Bjarni felt his worries for the coming battle melt away. Suddenly he was gulping it down, filled with the well-being that came from the comradeship of his ancestors and the brotherhood of the tavern song. \\n\\nHe looked around him with dream-filled eyes, surprised to note that the tankard was still full. He was about to comment but the owner prised it from his fingers and leaned in close.\\n\\n“There, now ye can go to battle knowing you have slaked your thirst on Bugman's original brew.”\\n\\nBjarni's head spun. Was this Bugman himself? Before he could blab out a question his eyes rolled and he slipped slowly backward and began snoring. When he awoke, the blare of the warhorns ringing in his ears, his friends of the night before were gone, but his body tingled in anticipation of the battle to come and he hurried to join his kin, ready for anything the Grobi had to offer.	false

gen_lore_dwf_dwarf_treasure_description	Every Dwarf family has its own hoard, its own treasures and heirlooms, which represents its store of wealth. Dwarfs do not keep valuables in a bank. Indeed, the idea of giving their gold to someone else to look after would make a Dwarf go weak at the knees.\\n\\nDwarfs like to have their treasure to hand, where they know where it is, but suitably well hidden from the world at large. To this end, the Dwarfs have developed many useful runes of concealment. They also are uncommonly good at making hidden doors, secret passages and impossible-to-find drawers or compartments.\\n\\nOf an evening, just before the family retires, a popular Dwarf pastime is that of counting the family’s money in front of the fire. Having spent a few happy hours fondling their wealth, the Dwarf family retires to bed satisfied, knowing that they can sleep peacefully with their treasure safely hidden away.\\n\\nHoarding wealth is a great passion among Dwarfs. They are an industrious race and work hard for their riches and possessions. When a Dwarf dies his possessions are divided amongst his family and so are passed on from generation to generation. A family’s treasure is held very dear as it is both a source of wealth and a link between the living and the dead. No Dwarf feels secure unless his treasure hoard is heaped high enough for him to sit on.\\n\\nThe hoards of some ancient Dwarf lords were of legendary proportions. Even today, the riches of the remaining Dwarf strongholds are a great attraction to Orcs, Goblins and other would-be conquerors, but the Dwarfs are extremely tough, and their strongholds have mostly withstood the test of time.\\n\\nNevertheless, over the millennia several great and proud strongholds have fallen to Orcs and other invaders: their populations dispersed and slain, and their hoards of gold and artefacts broken up and scattered across the world.	false

gen_lore_dwf_a_brewmasters_reflection_description	It is sometimes observed that the different characters of the High Elves and Dwarfs can be likened to their favoured beverages of wine and beer. Where the Elves savour fine wines carefully sipped from tiny crystal glasses, the Dwarfs noisily swill gallons of foaming ale, pausing only to belch loudly and bellow for more.\\n\\nThis contrast cannot have been more apparent than during the visit of the Elf Phoenix King Bel-Shanaar to Karaz-a-Karak, when, according to the hold's Book of Honour, the Elf king presented the Dwarf king Snorri Whitebeard with a single casket of Ellyrion wine, a vintage so rich and precious that the cost of a single glass would bankrupt the average Elf lord.\\n\\nThe Dwarf king, keen to show his appreciation, stove in the barrel lid with his axe and guzzled the whole lot in one go, wiping the copious spillage with his beard as his fellow Dwarfs cheered loudly. Quite what the delicate Elven courtiers made of this performance is not recorded. It can only be imagined what the Elf King thought of the dozen barrels of Gutstrangle's Owd Nasty Dwarf Ale and two gallon Dwarf souvenir tankard that he received in return.	false

gen_lore_dwf_dwarf_music_description	Other races do not consider Dwarfs a very musical people. Dwarfs, on the other hand, know what they like. They like raucous singing. They like thumping their hands and pounding their fists rhythmically on the table. Most of all, they like their music loud.\\n\\nIn fact, once a Dwarf has a few pints of ale in his belly it is very difficult to stop him singing. When a company of Dwarfs gathers in a traveller’s inn the inevitable always happens: a great deal of ale is drunk and the Dwarfs will sing long into the night. As the evening draws on the songs get louder and increasingly vulgar, for Dwarfs have an earthy sense of humour at best, and are not overly sensitive about the feelings of more delicate folk. Their deep, grating, and bellowing voices are not generally appreciated by the likes of men. Elves have been known to go deathly pale and to quiver pathetically when obliged to listen to a Dwarf in full voice.\\n\\nDuring their infamous and now wisely forgotten tour of the Reikland, the Zhufbar Miners Close Harmony Choir drank the entire town of Grunburg dry and caused riots in Wissenburg, Kemperbad and Ubersreik. Their leader, the huge and extraordinarily obese Bonin Bullroarer, was arrested in Altdorf when his performance panicked some passing horses, leading to the Great Altdorf Stampede.\\n\\nTension was already high due partly to the Dwarfs' reputation for drunkenness, but also to the incalculable damage done to the Emperor's Window in Sigmar's Temple during Bonin Bullroarer's memorable performance of “She Was Only a Halfling's Daughter”.\\n\\nAs Bonin pointed out, it was hardly his fault if shoddy human workmanship had proven unable to stand up to his spirited singing... and the same went for the temple's poorly laid foundations.	false

gen_lore_dwf_expatriate_dwarfs_description	Referred to as “Manling Dwarfs” or “Flatlanders”, Expatriate Dwarfs get little respect from their mountain dwelling brethren. Some expatriates are outcasts or refugees, while others have freely chosen to live among humans.\\n\\nSome expatriates engage in less traditional careers. Most of these are considered by the Imperial Dwarfs to be of an unsavoury, and somewhat dishonourable, nature. Such careers include rat catcher, thief, tomb robber or other “roguish” careers.\\n\\nIn smaller towns and villages, Expatriate Dwarfs are considered part of the community, especially in the Empire. They generally follow the same laws, customs and traditions as their human neighbours. The other clan members of these Dwarfs will often be scattered throughout neighbouring villages and small towns, but all will come together at times to celebrate one of Grungni’s holy days, exchange news and gossip, and pay respect to their ancestors.	false

gen_lore_dwf_stonemasons_description	Since time immemorial, the skill of Dwarf stonemasons has been the envy of all races. Their fortifications and under-ground constructions have withstood the test of time and the pounding assaults of their enemies.\\n\\nIn fact, the greatest threat to the masons' labour is the betrayal of the earth. The volcanic explosions and massive earthquakes that heralded the Goblin Wars severely weakened a number of Dwarfholds, rendering them susceptible to attack. Eventually, however, Dwarf fortifications were strengthened, and the underground living quarters rebuilt.\\n\\nLike other large craftguilds, the Masons are found wherever Dwarfs dwell. Their skill is highly prized by humans, and their handiwork can be seen in many Imperial cities and fortifications. Notable examples of the Stonemasons' craft include the Great Cathedral of Sigmar in Altdorf and the Great Temple of Ulric in Middenheim.	false

gen_lore_dwf_war_thousand_fronts_description	The Dwarf city-fortress of Zhufbar resides in a deep chasm down the mountainside from Black Water, a few days' trek from Karak Varn. High above the city, a huge waterfall cascades from the lake and rushes fiercely down the chasm – a natural wonder that Dwarf engineers use to turn thousands of water wheels, which in turn power drop hammers, ore crushers and all manner of mining operations.\\n\\nThe earthquakes broke the outermost fortifications and drained the lake, and even as the giant wheels creaked to a halt, the attackers came. Orc tribes laid siege on all sides while from numberless tunnels below came Skaven and Night Goblins. Fighting spread along the length of the chasm and much machinery was wrecked.\\n\\nAt one point, the Dwarf defenders were driven back into their halls, before they stubbornly advanced to cast many foes down the mountainside. To their amazement, so much blood was spilt into the chasm that the few unbroken drop hammers began to work again – devices quickly put to work driving the remaining foes out. Zhufbar held only after the lower levels were collapsed. It would take over 300 years to rebuild.	false

gen_lore_dwf_war_of_vengeance_description	Betrayal and arrogance on the part of the Elves ended a long age of prosperity. For the Dwarfs, the treasonous behaviour of their recent allies was not wholly unexpected. Ever pragmatic, they had identified their trading partners as a fickle lot, prone to wayward moods. Naturally suspicious, many Dwarfs reckoned it was only a matter of time before the capricious Elves turned – after all, Dwarf craftsmanship was so prized it was bound to trigger jealousy in others. \\n\\nThe first acts of the war were brutal raids attacking Dwarf trade caravans. All evidence pointed to the Elves, many of whom were subsequently slain by vengeful Dwarfs. When word reached the Dwarf High King, Gotrek Starbreaker, a prudent and wise lord (as evidenced by his long beard), he halted his thanes from war-making. Instead, he sent envoys to far Ulthuan to lay their claims before the Phoenix King, Caledor II.\\n\\nIn this way, Gotrek hoped to resolve the dispute peacefully by demanding wergild. A Dwarf will never forgive a grudge, yet in cases of misunderstanding, an exorbitant tribute of gold and gems, called wergild, coupled with sincere contrition, could possibly prevent the Dwarfs from settling the score in their more traditional fashion.\\n\\nThe Elves received the Dwarf envoys with open scorn, mocking what they called baseless accusations. Such was their contempt for the Dwarfs' claims that the Elves deliberately conceived of an insult so grievous that no amount of gold could ever serve as recompense: the Dwarf ambassador had his beard shaved and was compelled to return home shorn of pride and bearing the message that the only way King Gotrek might gain a single gold coin was if he came to Ulthuan personally and begged before the Phoenix Throne. There could be but one response: war!	false

Never before, or since, has such a sight been seen – the full might of the Dwarfs, at the very height of their power, marching to war. Their oncoming was relentless.\\n\\nMany Elven colonies were attacked; the slender towers of the Elves proving no match for the war machines of the Dwarfs. Upon receiving word of the Dwarf assaults that were systematically levelling their outposts, King Caledor II emptied Ulthuan, amassing a fleet so large that his own council pleaded with him to leave some protection behind to guard the Elven homeland.\\n\\nYet the Phoenix King would not be denied; Caledor II himself led the armada. He and his reinforcements arrived just in time to break the siege of the port city of Tor Alessi, an Elf dwelling whose walls and defences had been built in cooperation with the Dwarfs during the peaceful days of their alliance. Thus began in earnest a war that would last for well over four centuries.\\n\\nBlinded by rage and overconfident from their sweeping early victories, the Dwarfs soon found their forces overwhelmed. In truth, they had judged the strength of their foe by the least of the Elven provinces, but now, the assembled might of Ulthuan was arrayed in full against them.\\n\\nAdding to the mounting bill of grudges, Caledor II slew Snorri Halfhand, the son of King Gotrek. In battles of ever escalating size and fury, the two forces met again and again, fighting back and forth across the Old World. Great magics and Dragon-riders were pitted against runic axes and impenetrable shieldwalls, and the lands were awash with blood.	false

In an act of stubborn defiance, the Dwarf army stood purposefully before the arrow storm of the Elves, intent on proving they could withstand the worst their foe could unleash. After hours, in desperation and rage, the Elf army had no choice but to charge into close combat, where the real slaughter began.\\n\\nMorgrim himself struck down Imladrik, Prince of Ulthuan, thereby earning the title of Elgidum, or Elfdoom. Yet the war went on, with victories and defeats on both sides. The Elven armies broke impotently over the strongholds of their foe, yet for their part, the Dwarf armies could not break their opponent either, so the war dragged on.\\n\\nIn a final push, Gotrek Starbreaker led his throng to drive the Elves back, besieging the walled city of Tor Alessi for a fourteenth and final time. At last, the walls were breached and, unable to flee, Caledor II was forced to face Gotrek in personal combat. The duel that followed lasted for hours, and as the Elf King's fortitude failed, Gotrek shattered his foe's sword with a well-placed hammerblow.\\n\\nDefeated, Caledor pleaded for mercy, but the Dwarf High King carried a burden of vengeance, and mercy was not his to give. After one more swing of his hammer, the fight was over. King Gotrek picked the Phoenix Crown from out of the splattered mess and proclaimed the grudge settled and that the Elves were welcome to come to Karaz-a-Karak to beg for their crown's return. Those Elves who survived withdrew from the Old World, their armies, like their arrogance, shattered in defeat. To this day, the crown remains in Karaz-a-Karak.	false

In -720 IC it was discovered when Dwarf miners accidently tunnelled into its lair. Stirred from its slumber, it sought retribution against those foolish enough to wake it.\\n\\nAround -650 IC it attacked the Dwarf King Baragor’s retinue as he crossed the Worlds Edge Mountains to marry his daughter to the son of the High King at Karaz-a-Karak, resulting in the bride’s death. This is commonly assumed to be the event that pushed Baragor to become the first Slayer King.\\n\\nBaragor tracked down Skaladrak and attempted to exact revenge, but he didn’t manage to kill the beast, taking only a scale and causing a grievous wound that forced the creature to flee. Many years later it attacked again, and Slayers and Dwarf Warriors alike banded together to form a massive army to march on its lair.\\n\\nAs the throng trekked across the mountains, they were set upon by Skaven ambushers. The ratmen had long known of the existence of Skaladrak’s lair, and had enjoyed watching the carnage it inflicted on the Dwarfs of Karak Kadrin. Now that it was in danger of attack, they would not stand idly by and lose their favourite terror-inflicting beast.\\n\\nThough the Dwarfs lost many, many lives, they managed to overcome the Skaven and, after a lengthy battle, the Dragon Slayer Throrin the Crazed succeeded in slaying Skaladrak.\\n\\nDespite its death, Skaladrak’s legacy would continue to be felt across Dwarfen history.

Even the act of marching to war is akin to the hunt, of tracking or stalking the prey. Battle itself is like unto the act of a predator running down its prey, or the clash of rivals fighting to the last to determine the right to leadership and territorial dominance.\\n\\nAfter a successful attack, a warherd will celebrate through the night, parading drunkenly around the fire, feasting on captives and glutting themselves on the spoils of victory. These celebrations resonate throughout the forests and are often audible in the towns of Men.\\n\\nOn those nights when the Bray-Shamans enact the foulest of their rituals by the light of Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon, the darkness is split by fearful screams and hideous chanting. No watchman will stray far from the light on such nights, for to wander into the shadows is to give oneself to the creatures than lurk in the dark.\\n\\nBy noon the following day, the herd will have moved on, leaving destruction and devastation in their wake.

Where these paths cross, there is to be found a site that is in some way significant to the Cloven Ones. These beast-paths are located deep in the forests, far from the towns and highways of Man, yet they are far from hidden.\\n\\nThough native to the deep woods, the Beastmen are not naturally creatures of concealment and guile. When passing through the dense woodlands they simply barge their way through the foliage and trample flat the undergrowth. Over millennia of use, the beast-paths have become deep ruts in the ground, strewn with the bones of the enemy and other detritus.\\n\\nSo dense is the undergrowth that grows on the embankments, the chances are that no human tracker or huntsman seeking a beast-path would find one other than by pure happenstance. Any huntsman who did stumble upon a beast-path would be extremely wise to turn and flee, for a warherd might be travelling the path and his own bones may soon be added to those discarded upon it.\\n\\nOccasionally, two Beastmen warherds will run into one another whilst travelling in opposite directions along a beast-path. In such cases, the chieftains of each tribe will barge their way to the fore and meet in the centre of the pathway to decide which tribe will stand aside and allow the other to pass.\\n\\nAmidst much bravado and exaggerated strutting, the chieftains will engage in vulgar displays of power until one either stands aside or, far more likely, the two come to blows. The ensuing combat will consist of the two chieftains clashing horns and headbutting each other until one is knocked unconscious and the winner determined. The winner's tribe will then pass along the beast-path, the grinning Gors only pausing to relieve themselves upon the prostrate form of the defeated chieftain.	false

gen_lore_bst_gaze_of_the_dark_gods_description	In pursuing their endless hunt some Beastmen commit such acts of savagery and bloodshed that the attentions of the distant deities known as the Gods of Chaos are turned their way. Ordinarily the Ruinous Powers pay little heed to the deeds of the Beastmen, knowing that the Children of Chaos will enact their will regardless of any gifts or rewards offered.\\n\\nThe Beastmen are at once utterly in thrall to the magnificence of Chaos, and totally free of any constraints upon their thoughts and actions. They do as they please and, so doing, serve Chaos with every shred of their being.\\n\\nThough they do not truly comprehend it, the Beastmen are a vital part of the Ruinous Powers' eternal quest to subsume the world in a roiling, turbulent tide of unreasoning change and constant war. It is the Beastmen that tear down the elegant Elven waystones that hold the power of Chaos in check and replace them with herdstones – primitive shrines to the fell gods.\\n\\nIt is the Beastmen that hunt down and kill those who would otherwise remain out of the reach of the Chaos Gods. So it is that the Cloven Ones remain at the forefront of the war against order and light.	false

gen_lore_bst_morrslieb_subtitle	Morrslieb	false
gen_lore_bst_morrslieb_description	Of all the creatures of Chaos, Beastmen have an especially close relationship with Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon. Whenever Morrslieb is fullest in the sky the Beastmen will hold night-long, sprawling orgies where they indulge every base lust and bloodthirsty deed they can think of.\\n\\nMuch blood is shed, much captured wine and beer is drunk, and many new beast-spawn are conceived, ensuring the cycle of twisted and unholy life is perpetuated. Though it is rumoured that the witches and heretics of the Old World join the Beastmen in these frightening and confusing bacchanales, none have ever been able to say for certain, for to stumble upon a camp of blood-drunk Beastmen celebrating under the unclean light of Morrslieb is to plunge into hell itself. \\n\\nThose Beastmen who spend too long under the Chaos Moon’s gaze are slowly transformed by its energies. Spectacular twisting horns grow from the warrior's brow, hands sprout long razored talons that bleed poison, teeth enlarge into vicious swords of bone, skin secretes acidic mucous and hair clogs into an impenetrable hide.\\n\\nStill stranger transmutations include bodies of living flame, fang-studded appendages that grow from the recipient's gut, coal-black skin that draws in the dark shadows, limbs that end in the gnashing heads of the bearer's victims, bodies that swell into monstrously obese shapes, and a thousand other sickening forms besides.\\n\\nThose who are bestowed with an abundance of the Dark Ones’ gifts eventually devolve into Chaos Spawn: a writhing mass of flesh and tentacles, the epitome of nightmare and unreason. These bloated, writhing, slavering creatures exist on the periphery of the warherd, surviving on scraps, incautious Ungors, the dung of Tuskgors or whatever they can catch in the surrounding woods.	false

gen_lore_bst_encampments_description	Beastmen encampments themselves are crude affairs, often consisting of little more than a raging pyre surrounded by a mass of rude burrows and rough pelt barriers. Sometimes other skins, still dripping with gore, will be held up by sticks and branches to form makeshift tents.\\n\\nThe more powerful Beastmen, such as the Minotaurs and the Bestigors, take up the positions closest to the fire and closest to the food. The smaller Ungors are pushed to the outskirts of the ring, and it has been known in winter for many of the weaker beasts to perish. Chaos Warhounds prowl the edges of the campsite, fighting over discarded bones and often preying on the smallest Beastmen.\\n\\nThe treetops all around the encampment are haunted by Harpies, twisted beings that from a distance appear as winged and shapely human women. These creatures follow the tribe wherever it goes, attracted by the remains of sacrificed victims scattered about the encampment. They squabble constantly for the choicest pickings of the food the Beastmen discard. In some camps hideously mutated Chaos Spawn are kept in rough pens of sharpened stakes where they are taunted and starved until set loose in battle.\\n\\nTo stumble upon a Beastman camp is not only to witness a cacophonous vision of hell in full flow, but also to consign oneself to a grisly and extremely unpleasant death.	false

gen_lore_bst_herdstones_subtitle	Herdstones	false
gen_lore_bst_herdstones_description	To the Beastmen, the most sacred of all the dark places of the woodlands are the monolithic herdstones. These are the meeting grounds of the Beastmen, and take the form of dire and foreboding standing stones. These are often immensely ancient, hewn or even grown from fallen meteors into twisted mouths, skulls and spires that hurt the eye, decorated with the runes of Chaos, the Dark Tongue.\\n\\nThe herdstones are always erected in places of magical significance, usually over one of the baleful meteors that brought the Beastmen into being all those ages ago. They are well hidden and there are almost always Beastmen warherds and Minotaur tribes nearby. About each herdstone is to be found great piles of offerings, rusting weapons and armour taken from long-defeated enemies. The floor of the clearing in which the herdstone stands is often strewn with an ankle-deep carpet of bones, the remains of the captives taken in battle and sacrificed by the Bray-Shamans to the dark glory of the Ruinous Powers.\\n\\nMost herdstones are located far from human settlements, for no such settlement founded near one has survived more than a single season. Any intrusion within a hundred leagues of a herdstone will cause every warherd in the region to descend upon the intruder with unrelenting wroth.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_realm_of_chaos_subtitle	The Realm of Chaos	false
gen_lore_bst_realm_of_chaos_description	The Old World is saturated with the mutating power of magic, the stuff of Chaos. It howls through the broken dimensional gate in the far north, creating and sustaining the violent and surreal land known as the Realm of Chaos. From there it permeates the entire world, perverting and transforming everything it touches into horrible new forms.\\n\\nThis power is strongest in the immediate area around the shattered gateway, but further away, the power of the mutating magic weakens. Because of this the far north of the Old World is home to many strange creatures distorted by the power of Chaos. All manner of Daemons and unrecognisable monstrosities haunt these regions, yet even when the Winds of Magic grow strong, these unholy warriors cannot wander too far south, for the power of Chaos becomes too weak to sustain them.\\n\\nThe Beastmen have no such limitations. Though born of Chaos, they are native to the forests and the whole of the Old World is their hunting ground. They wander at will, waging war upon who they please, and their endless hunt is as unrelenting as it is merciless. For the power of the Beastmen comes not from the fickle Winds of Magic, but from muscle, fang and the savage spirit within.	false

gen_lore_bst_the_challenge_subtitle	The Challenge	false
gen_lore_bst_the_challenge_description	Once the Beastmen have gathered in great numbers, the caller of the brayherd demands that the assembled chieftains submit to his will and follow him to war. Inevitably, another will challenge the caller's right to lead the brayherd, and ritual combat will ensue. If the combatants are mismatched, the challenge is over very quickly, for no quarter is sought or given.\\n\\nAt that point, the victor will deliver the killing blow, and before the defeated chieftain has breathed his last breath, rip open his ribcage and draw forth the still-beating heart from within. There ensues a gory spectacle in which the corpse is flayed by the victor, the skin to be added to his banner.\\n\\nOccasionally, another challenger steps forward – it is not unknown for a succession of challenges to be fought. When at last the victor is determined, there being no more chieftains willing or able to challenge the present incumbent, the assembled Bray-Shamans will announce that the matter is decided and declare the victor the Beastlord.\\n\\nSometimes the gathered Bray-Shamans will fail to agree that the victor of the challenge has the blessings of the Dark Gods to lead the brayherd. They may disagree on the meanings of certain portents read in the entrails of their foul-smelling offerings, or they may declare that those portents are entirely against the victor and another must be found. The challenge begins all over again, until a Beastlord who is able to demonstrate the blessings of the Dark Gods is victorious.	false

gen_lore_bst_call_of_the_doombull_subtitle	Call of the Doombull	false
gen_lore_bst_call_of_the_doombull_description	It is not only Wargors and Beastlords that call the brayherd – sometimes the dread Minotaurs known as Doombulls will do so instead. Whereas a chieftain will have plotted and schemed and taken counsel from his shaman, a Minotaur will simply be responding to a deep-seated urge to destroy. A ravenous hunger – known as the bloodgreed – comes upon them, and they bellow a deafening war cry that raises an echo in every Beastman that hears it.\\n\\nSometimes a shaman will attempt to guide the actions of a Doombull, but Minotaurs being simple creatures, his counsel must be suitably blunt and to the point. In all likelihood, simply informing the Doombull of the location of a large amount of “meat” (Men, Dwarfs, or maybe Elves) will be sufficient to bring on the bloodgreed. This is dangerous for the shaman, for he could be caught up in the general anarchy as scores of Minotaurs stampede to war. Fortunately, the Minotaurs believe it is bad luck to kill a Bray-Shaman, though accidents do of course still happen.\\n\\nAmbitious shamans may attempt to control a Doombull instead of merely offering counsel. Some even go so far as to possess the body of a Doombull, using it to call the brayherd and lead a full scale invasion. This is disapproved of by the other Bray-Shamans, for when discovered it does great damage to their ability to guide events according to their plans.\\n\\nA Doombull that discovers it has been manipulated in such a manner will be driven into a rage, and seek revenge against the offending shaman, his anger overcoming the ingrained proscription against harming such a creature. In the case of the Doombull Kha’Rak Stoneheart, the spirit-bond was discovered almost instantly. Yet before the shaman's spirit could break free, the Doombull took his vengeance, smashing the Bray-Shaman's recumbent body to a pulp.\\n\\nThe shaman was thereafter trapped in Kha’Rak’s mind, and now both war constantly to assert their dominance over Kha’Rak’s body, the towering Doombull as likely to stand firm and unleash dark magics upon his foe as he is to charge headlong into combat.	false

gen_lore_bst_dark_forest_subtitle	The Dark Forest	false
gen_lore_bst_dark_forest_description	Most of the cities, towns and villages scattered throughout the Empire are located along its mighty waterways. Few roads penetrate far into the deep forest, and those that exist must be maintained constantly lest the woods reclaim the land Man has cleared. So thick is the forest canopy that a traveller could walk for weeks without seeing the sun.\\n\\nEven a well-trodden or paved path will entirely disappear as first undergrowth, then questing roots creep from the treeline like thieves in the night to undo what Man has wrought. Only a fool would venture far from the safety of a town or fortress, for the darkness beneath those gnarled branches is the domain of the Beastmen.\\n\\nThe sprawling forests of the Old World are scattered with dark places into which no wholesome creature wanders. Monoliths known as herdstones, around which the brayherds gather, are each linked to the next by the hidden paths known only to the Beastmen. There are a multitude of other equally noisome places, including the haunted barrows of long dead warrior-kings, torrid living shrines to Chaos, huge and ancient hag trees hung with the remains of the brave, foul-smelling labyrinths that house gibbering Jabberslythes, and places that at first appear normal but lead into dimensions of illusion and madness. The Beastmen rejoice in all such places, gathering there to praise the Dark Gods. The warherd's raucous braying can be heard for countless miles all around, as can the screams of those sacrificed upon the bloody altars and unholy ground.\\n\\nOn nights when Morrslieb waxes full, it is as if every Beastman in the forest is braying, bellowing, barking and cavorting in some feral ritual. At such times, the entire forest resonates to the harsh chanting led by the Bray-Shamans. The warherds' pyres rage high above the trees, and a miasma born of unclean concoctions and the stink of burning flesh creeps across the lands, touching the unquiet dreams of Men and turning them into nightmares.	false

gen_lore_bst_enemy_within_description	The nobles of the Empire maintain many isolated hunting lodges in the woodlands of the Reikwald, and forbid common men from hunting there. It is rumoured that hidden away in these lodges, covens of these nobles and ladies of the court engage in forbidden worship of the Ruinous Powers and cavort with the Beastmen around raging pyres when Morrslieb is full.\\n\\nSuch fraternisation may eventually extend to acts of outright treachery. Many are the times a walled town's gate has been unbarred in the middle of the night, allowing a Beastmen horde to overrun defenders who believed themselves safely tucked away from the horrors of the forests.	false

gen_lore_bst_honouring_the_dead_description	When a Beastman chieftain is slain in battle, all of his followers mark his passing with raucous feasting around an ancient herdstone. If the dead chieftain is particularly renowned, many warherds may come to the feast and a great brayherd is held.\\n\\nAt the feast, the chieftain's corpse is eaten by his followers. The choice body parts are eaten by his oldest and most favoured retainers. The new chieftain consumes his predecessor's heart, gulping it down in one bite to the roars and wild chanting of the others.\\n\\nThe Ungors, on the other hand, will be lucky if they get to chew on a finger.	false

gen_lore_bst_empire_of_the_beast_description	If the Old World could be glimpsed from above, it would appear much as an ocean of forest dotted with specks of flickering light. The cities of Men are little more than lonely islands rising out of this untamed sea, their nations nothing more than scattered archipelagos. Surrounding each city, town and village is an impenetrable mass of ancient and gnarled forest, within which uncounted horrors lurk.\\n\\nTo stray even a short distance from the few roads that cross the forest is to invite death at the hands and teeth of any one of the myriad of nameless things that call it home. Most dangerous of all of these denizens are the Beastmen, for the Children of Chaos do not simply wait for their prey to wander into the benighted woodlands – they emerge from the forests and seek out their enemies, no matter how tall the walls behind which they hide.\\n\\nSo much of the Empire of Man is swathed in forest, and so many Beastmen dwell within that realm, that it could be considered a nation within a nation. When the Beastmen rise up and invade the lands of Men, they do so not as an army that must fight its way across a defended border, but as one already surrounding its foe's last redoubts.\\n\\nThe Empire must garrison every single village, town and city and patrol every road and river, for otherwise the warherds of the forest will strike where and when they please, plunging their blades directly into the heart of the Empire.	false

gen_lore_bst_winds_of_change_description	The dark forests in which the Beastmen dwell are ever changing and growing, driven by the god that Man calls Tzeentch. The endless variety to be found amongst the savage beasts of the forest is granted by this power. It is the same being that takes the essential features of the beast – horns, tusks, teeth and muscle – and twists and distorts them into weapons far stronger than any blade forged by Man, Elf or Dwarf.\\n\\nThe particular blessings of this god are evident in those Beastmen that sport mighty horns twisted into all manner of complex, yet razor-sharp forms and in those whose skin and fur is resplendent with unique or outlandish markings and patterns.	false

gen_lore_bst_transformation_of_heinrich_oncemann_description	One fell night when dark Morrslieb leered fat in the sky, Heinrich's body came to resemble that which festered in his soul like a rotting wound, an unhealed scar. Every beast in the village whickered and shrieked in fear that night, but Heinrich's screams were loudest of all, for Morrslieb's caress is not gentle.\\n\\nUnder the pallid moon his skull cracked and his eyes rolled. Hair sprouted and jaw gnashed, legs swelled, snapping and grinding and gristle-cracking loud enough to wake a corpse. New joints and muscles buckled and stung, blood-slick horns forced from black-thatched crown, toes gammed and hardened into flesh-ridged hooves. A long braying laugh tore its way from Heinrich's wattled throat as his hairy face lengthened into a biting maw, thick with teeth to grind and pierce.\\n\\nThe-thing-that-was-once-Heinrich gathered its black blades to its thatched chest and ran, ran on bone-splintered legs into the depths of the forest.	false

gen_lore_cst_secret_buried_treasure_description	Though shrouded in a foul mist the sounds of digging could be clearly heard. If one were brave enough to go into the fog they would see a dozen figures with shovels and pickaxes digging, with a towering figure overlooking their work.\\n\\nThose mad enough still to get close enough to see the fine details would notice that the diggers were dressed in livery common to pirates, with their observer being a captain, however by this point it would be too late. The “crewmen” were half rotted corpses brought back from the dead, their master was as pale as the moon, sported blood red eyes, sharp fangs and a distinctly Gothic style of uniform.\\n\\nA vampire captain and their crew. And judging by the number of holes on the beach, they were very determined and clearly looking for something. Of course there was really only one thing that could convince a vampirate to waste time digging holes instead of sailing the high seas: gold.\\n\\n“Permission to speak cap'n?” said the only “living” member of the crew, although even then it was pretty difficult to tell him apart from the rest, looking almost like a corpse himself. Mr Gibbs, the ship’s necromancer and cook.\\n\\n“Speak,” the vampire captain, being quite bored (and the necromancer being too valuable to eat), granted the request.\\n\\n“I was just thinking, we are looking for a chest full of gold right? Where do these chests come from and why would someone bury them rather than, I don't know... spend it?”\\n\\nThe captain sighed, “Because, Mr Gibbs, someone wanted to hide it.”\\n\\n“I mean that much is obvious, but why hide the loot?”\\n\\nMore questions. The vampire was losing patience. Combined with tropical heat, running out of blood-rum two weeks ago, frustration of having spent a month following this bloody treasure map and not really being a people person in the first place (with this being the longest conversation she has had with Gibbs since she first recruited him a year ago), she was basically at the end of her rope.\\n\\n“I don't know! There's lots of reasons to hide treasure! A mercenary hiding a pay chest after a disastrous battle, a thief's stash of ill-gotten gains, a pirate saving up for retirement, noble's avoiding taxes, a smuggler's stash or maybe someone just gets off on this! Does that answer your question Mr Gibbs?!”\\n\\nThe necromancer had gained the full attention and gaze of the vampire, one filled with frustration, anger and more than a little hunger. Like a rat the necromancer scurried backwards, well aware that the creature in front of him could easily tear him limb from limb or drain him like a flagon of ale. But before the situation could develop further, the sound of metal on wood, a distinct “thunk”, gained both their attentions.\\n\\nIt had taken a month of searching and a week of digging but they finally found it! The deckhands dug out the sand surrounding their prize and dragged it to the surface before standing at attention (or at least what passed for it with zombies). The chest required a key, though petty locks were not going to stop them now. The vampire discharged her pistol before prying the chest open with a shovel.\\n\\nInside were coins, jewels, pearls, rubies and all manner of valuable things, every pirate’s dream.\\n\\n“You think the admiral would miss one or two missing baubles?” asked the Necromancer.\\n\\nThe vampire smiled for the first time in a century.\\n\\n“Mr Gibbs, that's the first smart thing you have said all day.”	false

gen_lore_cst_new_voyage_new_crew_description	One of the most things need for a successful voyage of any kind is, finding the right kind of crew, whether it is a trade mission to Lothern, raiding the coast of Lustria, attempting an expedition to Cathay or prowling the seas as an undead reaver. Experience is key: not too green, but still hungry for war and lucre. Finding the right crew could be difficult, particularly when it came to the right officers.\\n\\nFortunately, many an experienced privateer can be found in a dockside tavern, though if you are looking for someone in the dark arts you will need to find an establishment with a certain... reputation.\\n\\nThe Dead Whale was one such establishment. Situated in the middle of a failed Estalian colony somewhere on the Tarantula coast, the area has long since become a haven for the scum of the sea, both living and undead, but gained just the right reputation needed after a coven of Necromancers settled in the local graveyard. All that was needed now was to find a diamond in the rough.\\n\\nIndeed, whilst it is not necessary for a Vampire to run their ship, having a mortal knowledgeable in the necromatic arts onboard not only helps bolster the crew, but also allows the captain to delegate, letting them focus on more important matters... like blood rum.\\n\\nAt a small table in the corner of the mostly abandoned tavern, a cloaked figure interviewed a potential recruit, noting down everything they could in a little black book. “Welcome Mr...?”\\n\\n“Gibbs, Johnny Gibbs, at your service ma'am!” Replied the necromancer. One would be forgiven for thinking the man a corpse as he half looked like one himself, with rotting teeth, a skinny frame and unkept fatigues. He certainly smelled like a corpse.\\n\\n“Previous occupation?” asked the figure across from him. Gibbs could not see them fully, but he could sense their dark power. There was no doubt in his mind that she(?) could help him with his research immensely.\\n\\n“Thirty years as an apprentice under-”\\n\\n“Before that, ” the figure interrupted.\\n\\n“Uh... ten years a ship’s cook.”\\n\\nThe figure stopped writing “A... cook? What can you cook??”\\n\\n“I don't see how this is-”\\n\\n“Answer the question.”\\n\\nGibbs swallowed dryly “Oh you know, beef, pork, fish, sweet pork. I do a really good Homard de Bretagne... ” the cloaked figure nodded. She did like a good crab.\\n\\nAs Gibbs continued to answer their questions, the figure continued to jot down what he said in her notebook until the final question. “How long are you planning on serving?”\\n\\n“Well... as long as I can, I suppose. I can't really continue my research without field testing. I'll take whatever service you can offer.” The figure couldn't help but smirk at those magic words. If she had her way he would be having a very long service indeed.\\n\\nThe figure closed her book. “You’re hired. Welcome aboard, Mr. Gibbs...”\\n\\nGibbs stuck out his hand, expecting a handshake that never materialised. The “captain” instead chose to stand up.\\n\\n“... however, you will need to prove your skill if you wish for long term service. Have a crew ready by midday tomorrow and you will get it,” the figure said. She then turned and walked towards the door.\\n\\n“Hang on a minute! Where am I supposed to find the corpses?!”\\n\\n“You’re a necromancer; figure it out.”\\n\\nWithout another word the captain left, leaving Mr. Gibbs to his own devices. It was almost midnight, so the necromancer ordered a flask of rum and prepared for a very long night...	false

gen_lore_ogr_gragus_boast_part_1_description	The Ogre Tyrant Gragus Brawlhammer, of the Big Club tribe, belched a deep-throated discharge. As the echoes of the mighty expulsion reverberated from the surrounding mountainsides, Gragus made his ceremonial announcement.\\n\\n“I’ve been all over the world and I’ve eaten everyfing that walks. But it weren’t ‘til we came back to these mountains that I almost met my match. This beast,” said Gragus while waving a haunch of Wyvern-meat that would require a dozen men to lift, “nearly ate me. But I killed it, and tonight we will eat it.”\\n\\nThis, naturally, brought raucous cheers from the tribe, who raised their own mighty hunks of meat into the air in salute. By Ogre standards, that had been quite a long speech and the tribe was glad to get back to eating. Yet their Tyrant had one more thing to say.\\n\\n“I ain’t never met my match,” said Gragus, “and I never will.”\\n\\nNo sooner had his boast been made than a distant peal of thunder sounded across the nearby peaks. The Ogres looked up to see the peak of Mount Grimtop above them illuminated by a streak of crimson lightning, followed by what seemed an unearthly roar. It is not unusual to see strange auroras over the mountains and fierce storms blow out of the Chaos Wastes, so the event went unremarked by all except the tribe’s Butcher, who felt his gut twist in premonition. He knew that battle was coming ... and soon.\\n\\nThe searing bolt had smote the summit of Mount Grimtop, and from the resultant fissure arose a Daemon, a glowering Bloodthirster wreathed in smoke. Thus was Krraggazz sent again to the material world to do the bidding of his master, Khorne; to beat the unbeatable, to humble the mightiest of mortals. Burning with an incandescent fire, Krraggazz unfurled his wings and howled his bestial challenge into the night. A vast daemonic host materialised at his bellowing call and darkness filled the skies, blotting out the stars. Krraggazz sniffed out the direction of his prey and began the long descent of the mountain - the deep snow melting with a hiss before his oncoming rage.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_gragus_boast_part_2_description	As Krraggazz’ legion made their way down Mount Grimtop, they encountered a herd of Rhinoxen. These beasts lay between the Daemons and their target, and the clash was inevitable. Although they could not see what was coming down the mountain towards them, the Rhinoxen could scent the danger, so they did what they always do ... they turned to face their assailants and broke into a lumbering charge. Krraggazz clove into the herd with axe and horns. With a resounding impact, half-a-dozen beasts were scattered high into the air, hurtling off the mountainside into the darkness below. Krraggazz’s axe chopped through hardened muscle and bone effortlessly. The Daemon legions followed, turning the slope into an abattoir; Rhinox-flesh and Daemon-gore splattered everywhere.\\n\\nMany pairs of eyes watched the slaughter for, like most of the great mountains of that range, caves pockmarked Mount Grimtop. From entrances obscured by deep snow and ice, Ogre Hunters emerged to urge on the many predators at their command. Sabretusks prowled the edges of the Daemon army, pouncing on any that became separated from their formations. Sometimes these beasts were met by claw or hellblade, yet many a Daemon was dragged off to its doom.\\n\\nAt the foot of the mountain, Gragus’ Ogres sighted the oncoming danger and dispatched their Mournfang Cavalry up the slopes to meet the threat. When the gibbering Horrors finally drove off the ravenous creatures with baleful magic, many Daemons had been crushed or driven back to the ether. Even more of the hellish host was lost to icewyrm pits or ambushing cragbeasts, but it was the Stonehorn that did the most damage. Urged on by Gargog the Red, its Hunter, the Stonehorn lumbered out of the ice-fog like the avenging spirit of the mountain and ploughed through the crimson ranks of Bloodletters, squashing them beneath its powerful limbs. With every angry twist of its head, the vast stone horns sliced lithe Daemonettes in half, their return blows barely scratching the beast’s rock-hard flanks.\\n\\nUp until then, Krraggazz had been unconcerned with the mounting losses among his minions and had pressed ever downwards, his only concern the boastful Gragus. But now he was forced to ascend to face the Stonehorn, and his roared challenge shook the mountain. Gargog turned the great beast to face the Bloodthirster. Pitting brute strength against battle incarnate, the two powers clashed. Krraggazz drew first blood, an axe blow that bit deep into the broad shoulders of the Stonehorn. Wrenching back, the Stonehorn forced one of its horns through the Daemon’s midriff, black ichor burning the earth as it spilt. Each combatant strained to topple the other when, with a sound like a cracking glacier, Krraggazz broke the horn in twain, freeing himself to once again swing his axe. Strengthened by his own mounting fury, the Bloodthirster rained axe blow after axe blow until finally the Stonehorn collapsed. Gargog himself was dispatched in short order. Only then did the Bloodthirster pause to pull the massive broken horn out of his body. For a moment Krraggazz seemed to flicker, his very being appearing momentarily translucent. Then, smouldering with the effort, the Daemon roared his triumph and solidified once more amidst his vanquished foes.\\n\\nThe skies were brightening with dawn when the beleaguered Daemonhost entered the valley below Mount Grimtop. There they found the Big Club tribe arrayed before them, prepared for battle. At the head of the Ogre horde stood the Tyrant, Gragus Brawlhammer- his boulder-club nonchalantly slung over one beefy shoulder. For a moment each side-eyed the other, appraising their might, before hurtling forwards to kill or be killed. The mauling bludgeons of the Ogres were pitted against the deathdealing hellblades of the Bloodletters; the lumbering might of Giants against the quick-slicing claws of Daemonettes. Leadbelchers fired devastating volleys into brass-armoured Juggernauts, whilst Ironguts matched rusted blades with foul Plaguebearers. At the epicentre of the maelstrom were Krraggazz and Gragus, the two towering leaders trading blows while the onslaught surrounded them.\\n\\nAnd that is where the Ogre legends begin to differ. Some say that Gragus defeated the Bloodthirster and went on to enjoy a long and illustrious career. Others say that Krraggazz smote the Tyrant and claimed his skull for the throne of his dark master. The majority of Ogres, however, believe the matter is still undecided. As one story goes, the din of battle was so fierce it caused an avalanche, burying both sides. Although most perished beneath the impossible weight, Gragus and Krraggazz still duel on in some subterranean catacomb, trading axe blow for club strike. Tribal elders point to ground tremors that periodically shake the area as proof of the legend.\\n\\nWhatever the truth, it cannot be denied that Mount Grimtop bears a great black fissure at its peak, or that the valley beneath it is buried in a landslide of colossal proportions; nor can any deny that a great, eight-pointed monolith now protrudes from the piled rubble. Neither side, however, has ever returned in force -preferring to leave that part of the cold realm well alone.

gen_lore_ogr_the_great_maw_description	The Great Maw is a gaping hole in the Eastern Steppes filled with ridge upon ridge of jagged teeth and rippling, convulsing muscle that stretches down into vast nothingness. It is the primary deity of the religion of the Ogres. Their relationship with this entity is not just one of devotion, but also one of fear, for the Great Maw was once responsible for the near-destruction of the entire Ogre race.\\n\\nWhen the Ogres began encroaching on Cathay’s lands, the Celestial Dragon Emperor and his astromancers summoned a comet to obliterate them. However, whether by unfortunate circumstance or Tzeentch’s design, what they pulled from the heavens was no inert rock, but a titanic warpstone containing a vast, ravenous creature.\\n\\nWorst still, not all the Ogres were destroyed, and Cathay’s once vital plains were reduced to a searing desert of howling sandstorms and toxic mists. To the Ogres it seemed that a vengeful deity had fallen upon them, consuming all before it: a great and terrible maw that existed purely to feed. Thus, the insatiable and merciless god of the Ogres was born.\\n\\nOgre legend tells of Groth Onefinger, the First Prophet of the Maw who led his tribe to look upon this new and powerful god. Hunger, flesh-tearing cyclones and nameless monsters plagued Groth and his tribe, but when they reached the Maw’s edge, what they saw was astounding, and has since been depicted on countless gut-plates and banners, and is forever etched into the consciousness of the Ogre race.\\n\\nThe presence of the Great Maw writhes in the minds of all Ogres, beckoning them to return, to stand upon that mighty precipice. So Ogres have become a restless race, forever seeking to escape from that whisper in the back of their minds that pulls them back to their gluttonous, yet insatiable god. Some Ogres, those that have travelled around the globe, even claim that there is another Maw in the ocean on the far side of the world – a vast, fanged whirlpool that devours any ship that strays too close.\\n\\nYet no distance is great enough to escape the pull and lure of the Great Maw, no ritual or feast can fully appease its eternal appetite and, whilst it hungers still, its barbarous sons will feed and feed and feed until they consume the world...	false

gen_lore_ogr_working_together_subtitle	Working Together (or not)	false
gen_lore_ogr_working_together_description	Ogres see other tribes as competitors for food and it is best to demonstrate to others that your tribe has larger and more powerful warriors. To this end Ogres constantly engage in highly visible feats of strength, such as climbing sheer cliffs, hurling immense boulders or pulling Hydras out of their rocky dens. Fighting between tribes is common and usually concludes with the weaker tribe being absorbed by the victor. Tribes do not always battle and there are occasions when it is advantageous to work together.\\n\\nFor example, when the barbaric men from the north last swept down from the Chaos Wastes in great numbers, they were repelled by an alliance between the Bloody Fists and the Mountaineaters. That great victory is still celebrated by the two tribes, who meet yearly to hold a Spawnroast.\\n\\nAt times the tribes have been united beneath an Overtyrant - a ruling king that holds power over all the other Tyrants. It takes a powerful individual to hold even minor leverage over distant tribes, much less rule over them. When there is an Overtyrant, it is far more common for multiple tribes to band together to conquer larger territories - vast armies of Ogres descending upon the world and smashing aside all opposition to take what they want.\\n	false
gen_lore_ogr_tribal_characteristics_title	The Ogre Kingdoms	false
gen_lore_ogr_tribal_characteristics_subtitle	Tribal Characteristics	false
gen_lore_ogr_tribal_characteristics_description	The Ogre Kingdoms are made up of hundreds of different tribes, each with their own ways and violent reputations. As Ogres are blunt and obvious, the tribal name often reflects the most overt tribal traits. For instance, the Skulltaker tribe have attained prominence for their successful hunts, and the borders of their kingdom are well marked with the skulls of beasts so large they defy belief. The Treehammers tribe is known for carrying oversized clubs and the Bloody Fist are recognised by their distinctive war-markings made from the blood of their enemies.\\n\\nEach tribe attempts to better its own reputation - a feat most often done the traditional Ogre way, that is, through prodigious acts of violence. For example, the Fleshgreeders, led by their immense Tyrant Nogflag the Gouted, would pile everything in a conquered territory that couldn’t be carried off or immediately eaten into a single immense mound before erecting a crude throne atop it. Nogflag would climb the pile to sit imperiously atop the throne during the victory feast. Following the festivities, the Ogres would stomp off, leaving their enormous monument of destruction behind, clearly marked with their tribal symbols. It was possible to follow the trail of the Fleshgreeders when they left the Mountains of Mourn - for they left behind them mounds of the various villages, fortresses, lairs and strongholds they dismantled.\\n\\nRegardless of their differing traits, most Ogre tribes reside within their own valley in the Mountains of Mourn, at least for a time. Ogres rarely spend too long in a single location due to a combination of their wanderlust, nomadic heritage and the general perception that remaining sedentary attracts the ire of their frightful deity. Although never spoken aloud, it is an Ogre belief that ‘if you stay in one place too long, the sky will fall on you’. While in a valley this means travelling between campsites, packing and resetting their great hide-covered huts, digging new maw-pits and the like. After a while, however, even this becomes too cramped and a Tyrant will lead his tribe on a journey - sometimes going far off into the world at large, wreaking much destruction as they go.\\n\\nBesides their weapons, Ogre tribes typically carry few possessions and so are ready to move at all times. One of a tribe’s most valued items is its Mawtooth, a stone that bears the tribe’s scrawled marks and sigils. This icon is carried to every new location and placed prominently in every new camp - often near the Tyrant’s hut, or in the ring of giant stones that encircle some Ogre camps.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_feasts_for_the_strong_subtitle	Feasts for the Strong	false
gen_lore_ogr_feasts_for_the_strong_description	There are a great many rituals shared by all the tribes that make up the Ogre Kingdoms, of which the most important are feasts. Feasts are special meals with the entire tribe present that can last for days or even weeks. Consuming meat is a religious matter for Ogres, for to eat a thing is to show superiority over it and it is a way of emulating the Great Maw, their all-consuming deity.\\n\\nFeasts aren’t just about eating, and central to any major event are contests - some are light-hearted sport for boasting rights, such as belching contests or Gnoblar flinging, but most are strength tests such as gut-barging, face-cracking and the like. Championship rounds are fought in the pit while the rest of the tribe cheers and jeers. Leadership challenges and personal grudges are often fought during special feats and, regardless of the outcome, whoever wins will doubtlessly hoist himself out of the maw-pit and call for yet more feasting.\\n\\nOnly an Overtyrant can call a Great Feast, a gathering of all tribes. The top Ogres from every tribe travel vast distances to make a Great Feast, dragging with them the largest game they or their associated Hunters can kill. Especially gifted Ogres (the loudest Bellower, for instance) are given the honour of carrying the tribe’s Mawtooth. \\nUpon arrival at the Great Feast, each Mawtooth is placed around the maw-pit, recreating the fanged hole that is the Ogre deity. Greasus Goldtooth, the current Overtyrant and ruler of the Goldtooth tribe, is especially known for his massive weeks-long events, where gifts are given to loyal tribes, and the disfavoured often meet misfortune in bloody and spectacular fashion.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_the_wanderers_subtitle	The Wanderers	false
gen_lore_ogr_the_wanderers_description	Some Ogres have branched out of the Mountains of Mourn, often hiring out as mercenaries and following the lucrative call of battle. Ogres can be found throughout the Old World, in the lawless lands of the Border Princes, the greenskin-infested Badlands, Araby and even Naggaroth. Those who leave intend to return one day, although whether they survive to do so is another matter. Ogres remaining in the Mountains of Mourn always welcome back such travellers, eager to hear tales of foreign battles and exotic things to devour.\\n\\nSome Ogres settle in these far away places for a time, enticed by the promise of rich pickings. The Ironfist tribe, for instance, has established residence at the eastern side of Peak Pass in the Worlds Edge Mountains, and many tribes frequent Gristle Valley, an Ogre stronghold in the Grey Mountains. Ogres are bold; the Backbreaker tribe infamously set up its camp within a few hour’s march of the city of Altdorf, piling up many toll fares before being driven off by an army led by Emperor Karl Franz himself.\\n	false
gen_lore_ogr_beasts_mountains_title	The Ogre Kingdoms	false
gen_lore_ogr_beasts_mountains_subtitle	The Beasts of the Mountains	false
gen_lore_ogr_beasts_mountains_description	Despite the inhospitable weather, the Mountains of Mourn teem with life. Herds of great woolly beasts are plentiful, crisscrossing the boulder-strewn slopes and snowy plateaus seeking food. They are primeval creatures that have existed unchanged since the world was still covered in ice. Due to their harsh environment, the beasts are hardy, but the weather and steep heights are not the only danger - a host of large and especially fierce predators stalk the mountainsides. To survive against the host of carnivores, even the lowliest herd beasts have developed tremendous size, great strength or some other defensive trait to combat the red-toothed hunters. The Rhinoxen, a common herd animal, will lower their impressively large horns and charge anything that doesn’t stink of their own kind. The twin horns of a Rhinox can gouge a furrow into a cliff face and no predator wishes to be on the receiving end of a charge from a single beast, much less a stampeding herd. Likewise feared are Ice Mammoths - icicle-encrusted pachyderms of colossal size, each equipped with lengthy tusks. It would take an entire pack of starving-mad Mournfangs, or something massive like a Frost Dragon, to dare a head-on confrontation with a fully grown bull mammoth. \\n\\nWhether predator or prey, hunter or herbivore, all the beasts of the mountains grow large and ferocious. The weak do not live long, succumbing to the elements or prowling monsters, their carcasses left to be picked over by the carrion-eaters. Even among this low tier of animals, the skulking scavengers grow menacingly large in the Mountains of Mourn. While blood vultures or fangweasels are little more than a nuisance to an Ogre, such pests are more than capable of taking down and slaying an unwary Gnoblar. The Mountains of Mourn are rife with Gnoblars, particularly around Ogre camps where the thieving creatures live a parasitic existence in the cracks and crevices. Close relatives of Goblins, Gnoblars are tolerated by Ogres, who find them too scrawny to eat, at least if there is anything else around. Some Ogre tribe even allow the little runts to fetch things or tag along to battles.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_ogre_origins_subtitle	Ogre Origins	false
gen_lore_ogr_ogre_origins_description	Where exactly the Ogres come from and how they fit in with the other races of the world is a question many scholars have asked. Of course such questions never occur to the Ogres themselves, for they are not scholarly in the least, being unable to read or write. Ogres do value legends - often exaggerated tales of bravado told around campfires – and they do record major events with their cave drawings, but to an Ogre, history means their last meal and ancient history is the feast before that. They are far more concerned with obtaining their next repast than with debating how or why they came to be.\\n\\nElven loremasters believe that the Old Ones, the mysterious beings who shaped so many of the creatures that walk the world, made the Ogres to join the fight against the rising powers of Chaos. However, the Elves theorise that quite a bit was left unfinished with the race when the polar gates collapsed, ushering in a tide of Chaos powers to the world. To the Elves, this explains the rude and intolerably vulgar nature of the Ogres, and hence the graceful rulers of Ulthuan generally disdain them as a lowly and dim-witted race.\\n\\nHuman scholars, led by the strangely prophetic Imperial philosopher Albrecht of Nuln, believe that Ogres are close kindred to the race of Halflings, perhaps coming from some common stock, but somewhere in time splitting into two divergent species, perhaps through some foul mutation. There are many similarities: both races are resistant to the effects of Chaos, both have a comparable and all-consuming need to search out their next meal, and both bear unusual behavioural traits – for Ogres the need to smash and eat everything, for Halflings the compulsion to swipe anything not nailed down.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_rhinoxen_lifting_subtitle	Rhinoxen Lifting	false
gen_lore_ogr_rhinoxen_lifting_description	The practice of Rhinoxen Lifting is a great tradition amongst certain Ogre tribes. When a relative of a wealthy Ogre Tyrant is young, he is often given an immature Rhinox and express instructions not to eat it. This Rhinox, having been reared from birth by Hunters, is relatively tame, hardly ever destroying anything in its path.\\n\\nIf the Ogre can pass the first test of not killing and eating the beast, every dusk and dawn the Ogre will lift the Rhinox above his head. This is relatively easy whilst the Rhinox is a calf weighing only a ton or so. However, the Rhinox grows along with the Ogre, and lifting the beast, in theory at least, becomes more and more difficult.\\n\\nBut because the Ogre lifts his Rhinox twice a day, the increments in weight increase that the Ogre has to contend with are tiny, so his strength gradually builds in proportion to the size of the Rhinox. By the time the beast and its master are fully grown, the Ogre is not only capable of truly incredible feats of strength, but also has an extremely large and juicy steak to look forward to at his coming-of-age feast.\\n	false
gen_lore_ogr_big_names_title	The Ogre Kingdoms	false
gen_lore_ogr_big_names_subtitle	Big Names	false
gen_lore_ogr_big_names_description	Ogre names are typically as blunt and obvious as their owners. This is because Ogres have a limited capacity for honorifics and titles, and lose interest very quickly after the first syllable or two. The exception to this are those names Ogres traditionally associate with great heroes; the so-called ‘big names’, which invariably tie into a hazardous feat the Ogre has undertaken in order to prove his mettle. In this way, an Ogre who has scaled the sheer face of Mount Thug with only his bare hands may adopt the name Mountaineater, whereas an Ogre who has slaughtered his way through a unit of knights with nothing more than a jagged rock and a bad hangover might take the name Skullcracker.\\n\\nWith typical Ogre directness, an Ogre’s name tells anyone alive long enough to hear it what that Ogre excels at or the particular skills he prides himself in. In this way an Ogre will know whether the Ogre he is talking to is worthy of great respect, having earned himself a big name.\\n\\nCertain Ogre feats are so difficult that Ogres very rarely even attempt them – tracking down and breaking a wild Giant, for instance. These are the tests by which a grown Ogre shows he is ready to challenge the Tyrant. An Ogre who achieves one of these extreme feats of prowess earns not only a big name but also his right to challenge the Tyrant to defend his crown.\\n\\nThose Ogres who go on to become mercenaries tend to exchange the name they earned during their rite of passage for a given name bestowed upon them by those they accompany into battle. These normally take the form of titles rather than surnames. Some of the oldest and most successful Ogre mercenaries may have long and ostentatious titles, often including words that they don’t even understand themselves; an Ogre Maneater is as likely to be called Brog the Unsanitary as he is Brog the Unstoppable. It is debatable if the Ogres care what their given name is, just so long as it sounds impressive. After all, anyone foolish enough to laugh at an Ogre’s name will find himself the wrong side of a gut-plate pretty quickly.\\n\\nAn Ogre’s name may change over the course of his life. For instance, Gulg the Hungry, upon his fifth change of gut plate to accommodate his spreading girth, decided to adopt the name Gulg the Fat. Some Ogres have almost comically long and overcomplicated names, but these mighty individuals invariably have enough status to keep a Name-Gnoblar or two around to remember the Ogre’s title.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_gut_magic_description	Known to the scholars of the Old World as Shamanic Victuals, Gastromancy, Thaumaphagy or Corpomancy, Gut Magic is quite unlike the arcane arts used by human wizards. Ogre Butchers use shamanistic rites that revolve around devouring parts of their victims, the items acting as fetishes that channel the raw power of the Great Maw.\\n\\nThese Gut Magic spells explain why the Ogre Butchers often appear to be walking larders, as to cast one of his shamanic spells the Butcher must physically eat anything from a nice healthy heart to a stinking pile of guts. In this act, he communes with the power of the Great Maw, taking some of it for himself and bestowing the rest upon his comrades that they might run roughshod over their enemies, or inflicting painful curses upon the heads of his foes.\\n\\nGut Magic spells work in a slightly different manner to other spells, because instead of manipulating the winds of magic, the Butcher is calling upon the power of his god and channelling it through a focus – Gut Magic spells are more religious miracle than arcane science.\\n	false

Everything in this garden is crafted from magical ice: glittering, diamond-like flowers and trees of frosted glass. Gravel pathways wind their way between a host of exquisite sculptures of ice-carved trees, exotic birds, and legendary beasts.\\n\\nIn the Winter Gardens, it is always midnight, no matter the season or time of day beyond its icy hedges. Moonlight bathes the garden in a monochrome brilliance, the silence and sense of isolation a physical thing within this icy wilderness of dragons, eagles, and bone-chilling cold. The Tzarina’s knights patrol the glittering undergrowth, and on certain days of the year, the Tzarina allows her subjects to enjoy the gardens.\\n\\nIn marked contrast to the Winter Gardens, the Summer Gardens are kept at a pleasant summer temperature all year round, another benefit of having a ruler whose power is said to come from the land. Magical barriers separate the chill climate of Kislev from this balmy garden of pleasant greenery, colourful flowers, and decorative topiary.\\n\\nHere, the rich and powerful of Kislev take the air without having to mingle with the common people of the city.

The temple in Kislev is one of the richest of Dazh’s temples and is dominated by a large, gilded statue of Dazh.\\n\\nThe air is wreathed in scented smoke from the hundreds of burning braziers and fire pits – which must never be allowed to go out – that are tended by the priests. With the Temple of Tor so close, the weather around this part of the city changes frequently, and thunder and lightning have been known to change to a warm, clear summer’s day in the time it takes to walk between the two temples.\\n\\nThe priests of Dazh are clad in gold jewellery, and the more senior priests positively glitter with the precious metal. In any other city, such ostentatious displays of wealth would attract the attention of thieves and rogues, but no Kislevite would dare attempt to steal from this temple, for they know that it was Dazh who gave the secret of fire to their ancestors, and without that gift, the winters of Kislev would be fatal.\\n	false

As much as any building can be said to squat, the Temple of Tor squats in the shadow of the Bokha palace, its thick stone blocks carved from the peaks of the Worlds Edge Mountains.\\n\\nA heavy, timber roof studded with copper rods covers the interior of the temple, and no matter what the season, the skies above the temple are always dark and heavy with the promise of thunder and lightning. Often, bolts of lightning strike the temple, and when this happens, Tor’s priests see it as an omen of things to come, reading the future in the patterns of the blue fire that ripples through the walls of the temple.\\n\\nA massive silver statue of Tor dominates the temple, a hugely muscled, square-jawed warrior bearing a mighty axe with a haft of oak with which Tor cleaves the sky to create his thunderbolts.\\n	false

Unlike the rest of Kislev, Morr is well-regarded, and even worshipped, within the walls of the civilised capital.\\n\\nRegardless of oblast tradition, the dead of Kislev are taken to the Temple of Morr, a gloomy, solid structure with broad doorways and ponderous lintels embossed with the symbols of the grave, where the bodies are prepared for their journey into the next world and buried in the Garden of Morr beyond the wall. The heavy scent of incense fills the air, and loved ones of the dead that can afford it often ask for a traditional Kislevite burial.\\n\\nThis practice involves the dead body being tied to the saddle of a horse (bought from the nearby Pulka’s Livery), which is then driven into the wilderness of the steppe. But this tradition is frowned upon by most of Morr’s priests because it delays the dead from arriving in Morr’s kingdom and leaves the body prey to the spirits of the land that may seek to perform unnatural magic upon it. As a result, a number of the sinister Black Guard of Morr often ride out alongside the dead and ensure that the proper rites are carried out upon it once they’re far enough away.\\n	false

Most were spared the Grand Parade’s fate, but others suffered afflictions of their own. Before the Great War, the street which came to be known as the Street of Shifting Signs was home to grocers who scrawled their wares and prices on the slate in chalk every morning.\\n\\nOn the other side of the wall was the home of a mad old seer who kept vast diaries of what he claimed were visions of the future.

This individual has the title Duke of Praag and resides in the New Palace.\\n\\nThe choosing of the duke is difficult, as a Kislevite loyalist will be uniformly despised by his people, while a favourer of Praag will defeat the purpose of the position. The newly appointed Duke Ivan Valeriki Kolarabinikov is well-thought of by the noble classes because, although he has no great military distinction, he makes almost no effort whatsoever to get involved in politics.\\n\\nThe exception is his dedication to maintaining his popularity among the lower classes, and he not only pays for the help wagons but has been known to hand out the bread rations personally. He is also a great lover of art and fancies himself a painter.\\n\\nIt is not unusual for a traveller through Windlass Square to discover half the royal household dressed as Kossars at the Longest Charge, while the duke furiously dabs at his canvass.

The vaulted ceiling inside the grand, baroque building still preserves the hole struck by cannon fire, and the stalls are decorated with the bones of the dead, forming macabre yet undeniably beautiful patterns.\\n\\nThe acoustics on stage are phenomenal, and to play here is an entertainer’s dream, the equal of appearing at the Breughel in Altdorf. The Opera House is a symbol of great pride to both the rich and poor of Praag, and nearly every person in town has attended at least once, thanks to the annual performance where everyone is allowed in for only a penny. Since this yearly event fills the halls with peasants, or muzhiks, these events are known colloquially as muzhik-hals.\\n\\nAll great Opera Houses have a ghost, and Praag’s is no exception. Everyone knows that the great pipe organ plays even when the building is empty. However, it is not being played by just any rogue spirit; the organ is tainted with Dark Magic and corrupts any who play it, driving them to commit lustful and violent acts. The long run of the Opera House organists who have gone mad or been arrested has been noticed, but such is the price of great music.\\n\\nThe Opera House is funded partly by the opera companies, partly by the duke, but mostly by the Operatic Society, a loose collection of the city’s wealthiest boyars who believe fervently in the promotion of great music. They also passionately believe in protecting their power and their incomes, and the prosperity of Praag ensures both.\\n\\nThey are the true rulers of the city, and they manipulate every part of it to ensure trade continues without undue influence from the south and that profits – their profits – remain high. Such profiteering chafes the boyars and guildmasters who are not members of the Operatic Society.

It was built as a magical college by Z’ra Rudolf II, who was fascinated by the magical arts and wished to gather all sorcerers to the city, be they Ice Witches, Hags, or the strange Wizards of the Empire.\\n\\nTraditionalist Ice Witches and Hags looked on in horror as, soon enough, the heights of the tower were bursting with Aethyric flames, arcs of frost-fire, and alchemical explosions, causing the townsfolk to dub it the “Fire Spire.” However, the witches’ vocal disapproval was soon proven wise for, during the Great War, the tower acted as a lightning rod to Chaos sorcerers and was forever twisted by Dark Magic.\\n\\nNow, the Fire Spire stands as a testament to the witches’ warnings, for none who enter its haunted chambers return; but, even so, the promise of lost magical wonders continues to tempt desperate treasure hunters. The Fire Spire still attracts both natural and unnatural phenomena, and being near it during a storm is a very bad idea.\\n\\nAlthough its inhabitants played a large part in defending the city during the Great War, the damage from the exploding spire and the remaining Chaos taint are forever associated with magic and its practitioners in a very negative way. Ironically, this prejudice – coupled with the large Ungol population and the risks of spellcasting – means there are almost no Ice Witches in Praag.\\n\\nHags are welcome, but none step onto its tainted soil unless they absolutely have to, leaving Praag almost entirely empty of spell casters (apart from travelling Empire Wizards seeking some lost lore). But the hags know that the city is not defenceless: they can sense that some deep power, perhaps the Ancient Widow Herself, watches over the city from below, though why and to what extent remains unknown.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_harbourmaster_subtitle	Harbourmaster	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_harbourmaster_description	The harbourmaster of Erengrad is Radii Synvasalisa. It is the most immediately powerful post in the city, as Synvasalisa has the authority to stop any ship from mooring, to inspect any ship at any time, and to levy the customs imposed by the government.\\n\\nMost previous harbourmasters gained the post by virtue of massive bribery. Synvasalisa gained it by being the only qualified member of the Harbour authority to survive the sack of Erengrad. He claims to have kept up a constant campaign of harassment against the occupying horde, and this is, in fact, only a slight exaggeration. He survived by being stealthy, alert, intelligent, and unscrupulous.\\n\\nHe has now turned his talents to becoming rich. It hasn’t taken long; he does not owe anyone any money, so he can keep all the bribes he extorts from merchants. He is sharp enough to keep the graft at a low enough level that no one wants to have him replaced, and he has actually increased the amount of customs duty flowing to the city by increasing the efficiency of inspections. Synvasalisa is now bored, however, and looks for a new challenge.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_bretonnian_quarter_subtitle	The Bretonnian Quarter	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_bretonnian_quarter_description	The Bretonnian Quarter is in one of the most flood-prone and undesirable areas of the city. Many of the merchants here are from L’Anguille and joke that it reminds them of home for two reasons. One is that the Bretonnian authorities give absolutely no support to merchants abroad, making it hard to negotiate for land in a better area. The second is that most of the Bretonnian merchants in Erengrad are not making very much money; for some reason, they never seem to strike it big.\\n\\nAs with the rest of Low City, the Bretonnian Quarter was destroyed during the Incursion. Many of the residents are still in tents and shacks, but a fine, wooden Grail Chapel, raised ten feet above the ground on nine massive wooden pillars, has just been completed. Ferragus of L’Anguille, the only moderately wealthy merchant in the quarter, insisted on building the chapel first, in the hope the Lady would bless them. Other residents noted it would be somewhere to go during the floods.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_empire_quarter_subtitle	The Empire Quarter	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_empire_quarter_description	Citizens of the Empire form the largest group of non-Kislevites in Erengrad, but the Empire Quarter is relatively small because many live elsewhere in the city, mingling with the natives. Indeed, about a fifth of the people residing in the Empire Quarter are Kislevites, a much higher proportion than in the other ethnic areas.\\n\\nThe focal point of the area is the Temple of Sigmar. The old one was destroyed when the city was sacked, but preparations for building the new one are proceeding well. Stones from the old structure have been gathered and set aside, the ground cleared, and orders placed for new materials.\\n\\nThe new temple is intended to be an even stronger fortress than the last, strong enough to survive any future assaults. This fortification has required deeper foundations, and the excavations opened a set of catacombs that appear to be associated with Sigmarite worship, but so far, two groups of explorers have failed to return. The priests, led by Calvin Three-Hammers, the high priest designate, are looking for an experienced group to find out what the problem is. Nothing has come out, so far, and the hole is guarded round the clock.\\n\\nThe other main building is the Empire Consulate, and this structure is newly completed. No Imperial consul has arrived as yet, but Chief Clerk Jekil Reichert expects one to be appointed very soon. In the meantime, he is dealing with immediate problems and building up a large stack of papers that need to be formally approved by the consul upon his arrival. Reichert is not entirely honest, and a consul who actually reads all of the papers would realise it. But Reichert does not feel that is likely.\\n\\nFinally, The Shining Comet is an inn and tavern aimed at travellers from the Empire. It provides Empire-style food, drink, and entertainment, and many guests comment that, whilst inside, one might think he was in Altdorf. Kristyn Becker, the landlady, takes that as the highest compliment.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_elven_quarter_subtitle	The Elven Quarter	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_elven_quarter_description	Erengrad has one of the largest Elven Quarters in the Old World. While it cannot match that of Marienburg, it may be even larger than the Elven Quarter in Altdorf, and it clearly exceeds anything found in L’Anguille or the south. Although the great trading houses in Ulthuan decided to withdraw their personnel before the horde arrived, more than half the Elves stayed to help defend their city. They were all slaughtered and the Elven Quarter razed to the ground.\\n\\nElves returned soon after the war, and now the quarter is being rebuilt. The bravery of the Elves who stayed gained the race a considerable amount of goodwill, and no one has questioned their motives for building a wall around their homes and warehouses.\\n\\nThe wall is thirty feet high and completely finished, and work is going on inside. However, no non-Elves have been allowed within since the wall was completed and the gate hung, so most of the city can only speculate. Money and trade goods continue to flow, however, so the speculation is mostly curious, rather than hostile.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_grand_market_subtitle	The Grand Market	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_grand_market_description	The Grand Market is the heart of Erengrad, despite being located in the Low City. It is the place where most goods are bought and sold, and just about anything can be found if you look hard enough. For some goods, flimsy cover stories are concocted, pretending they are something else, but in many parts of the market people do not bother.\\n\\nThe only exception, these days, is anything related to the worship of the Ruinous Powers. Such goods used to be available to people who could ask the right questions, but now, the whole city is too opposed to the Dark Gods for it to be a safe trade. Those who specialised in it give the new mood a couple of years, at most.\\n\\nThe market is heavily patrolled by guards funded by the guilds and boyars, as are the main approaches to it. No violent crime or theft is tolerated, though the sale of contraband and outright swindling are not a concern. Erengrad merchants are strong believers in “buyer beware” and in exacting revenge if someone dares to swindle them.\\n\\nAs a result, the Grand Market is safe for people who know exactly what they want to buy, how to make sure it is authentic, and exactly what a reasonable price is. Everyone else gets robbed to a greater or lesser extent.\\n\\nBecause the Grand Market is subject to occasional flooding, all stalls are temporary structures, and the merchants simply move them—and their goods—to warehouses in other areas until the floods recede. There is normally ample warning, but a flash flood in the Lynsk can lead to mayhem as all merchants flee for high ground at once.\\n\\nThe Grand Market was restored to very near its former glory soon after the hordes left, as merchants arrived and set up to sell to the refugees. It is now flourishing once more, and the area of the Low City around it – devoted to taverns for people who haven’t been sufficiently swindled at the market – is already fully rebuilt.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_cannoneers_compound_subtitle	Cannoneer’s Compound	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_cannoneers_compound_description	The city of Erengrad is one of the few places outside of Nuln in the Old World where cannons are manufactured. The Sea of Claws is possibly the most dangerous stretch of water anywhere, and ships need good defences against raiders, both Human and otherwise. As a result, a strong demand has always existed for ship-based weapons, and the first Erengrad cannon was cast over two centuries ago.\\n\\nThe Cannoneers’ Guild has prospered since then and is closely affiliated with the Shipwrights Guild. Erengrad cannons are not up to the standard of those made in Nuln, but they are substantially cheaper and lighter, which makes them better suited to ships. And most captains would rather have two Erengrad cannons than one Nulner.\\n\\nThe steady demand means this compound is possibly the only place in the Old World where someone with enough gold can walk in, put down the pouch, and leave with the cannon. A known ship’s captain could actually do that; anyone else would meet with delays, while the guild tried to figure out what the cannon was wanted for. A few mercenary companies use Erengrad cannons on land, however.\\n\\nThe Cannoneers’ Compound was utterly destroyed during the sack of the city. It did take a fair chunk of the invading army with it, as the last guildmaster, Dazhda Kudrov, detonated the guild’s entire store of gunpowder and shot as the enemy approached. The guild has yet to appoint a replacement, claiming they need proof that Kudrov is dead, ideally a corpse. No one really believes he would have left a body, but the guild is uncomfortable with overt hero worship; most believe the actual head of the guild will always be the vice-master in the future.\\n\\nThe Compound is in Low City because it is noisy, smelly, and dangerous. Most of the guild members live elsewhere, though a few live inside the walls. Completed cannons are mounted as advertisements near the entrance and elsewhere around the walls. The guild claims they are not loaded, but no gangs have been willing to call that particular bluff.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_low_city_subtitle	The Low City	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_low_city_description	Low City is the poor area of Erengrad. It was almost completely destroyed during the Storm of Chaos, but as its inhabitants were the sort of people with nowhere else to go, they soon returned, joined by those from settlements in an even worse state. People are rebuilding, but all the work is cheap and shoddy, as might be expected. There are still a lot of people living in tents; some of these are Ungols – lured in by the Hag Osul – who actually prefer that accommodation.\\n\\nThere is a significant advantage to being able to pick up your home and move; Low City is prone to periodic flooding from two directions. The first is unusually high tides, which generally occur a couple of times a year. The second is the river Lynsk, which often floods in spring, as the snows start to melt. Tidal floods only last a few hours, until the tide goes out again, but when the Lynsk floods, the water can remain for several days.\\n\\nThe areas of Low City nearest the river and sea are thus the least desirable, which means they are inhabited by the poorest and most desperate folks. The areas inland are more desirable but also more dangerous, as they tend to be claimed by groups of criminals with some resources but not enough to make it worth putting up a facade of respectability. These areas are ignored by the authorities for the most part.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_high_city_subtitle	The High City	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_high_city_description	The High City is the wealthy area of Erengrad. It is built on the slopes of the hills facing the bay, which has numerous benefits. It raises the houses above the risk of flooding, allows waste to flow away downhill, provides an attractive view, and means the area is sheltered from winds from all directions. As a result, the area probably has the most pleasant climate in the whole of Kislev.\\n\\nThe High City suffered greatly in the sack, but the number of stone buildings meant there was plenty of material available to rebuild. As a result, it has recovered more quickly than anyone thought possible, and it is common for walls to include fragments of decorated stone from old carvings or rocks scarred by the attack of inhuman forces. Most people think this adds character to the area.\\n\\nAs noted earlier, both the boyars and guilds planned to rebuild Erengrad, particularly the High City, on an elegant and unified plan. The area is now completely disorganised, as parts of both plans have been implemented, along with independent buildings by groups who never cared what the so-called “authorities” said. Main streets dead end into a wall or suddenly turn into tiny alleyways, and it is not uncommon for a building’s blank wall to face a large square, and its facade to open into a small side street.\\n\\nFor all that, the wealth of Erengrad is clearly visible; traders from the south expecting a semi-barbarian city are greatly surprised.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_tilean_quarter_subtitle	Tilean Quarter	false
gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_tilean_quarter_description	The Tilean Quarter used to be built around a spectacular wooden Temple of Myrmidia, but that burned in the sack. The new quarter has a space set aside in the centre for a new temple, but work has yet to begin on it. The quarter as a whole is notable for having a population of about five hundred and a fixed population nearer five thousand.\\n\\nThe whole area is controlled by merchant companies, mercenary companies, and crime families who send agents on short-term postings and replace them at least twice per year. The official reason for the shuffling of posts is that Erengrad is a dreadful place with foul weather, worse food, and drink that can dissolve diamonds. Many of the agents appreciate this rotation and feel their superiors are being generous and thoughtful.\\n\\nThe real reason is that Erengrad is far enough away for someone to establish an independent power base. Riccioli the Bald, one of the fixed residents, was well on his way to doing that before the sack. He lost everything, including his hair, in that disaster and now rebuilds his contacts.\\n\\nHe works as a go-between, introducing people to Tilean mercenaries and merchants and doing the same for Tileans who want contacts in Erengrad. It will take a long time for Riccioli to reach his former heights, and his resulting bitterness against the Ruinous Powers knows no bounds.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_erengrad_hag_house_description	The hags have a presence in Erengrad because there are some Ungols in the city. But their presence is smaller than they would like; the hags remember Erengrad used to be an Ungol city, and most of those living here favour a return to that situation.\\n\\nOsul, one of the leaders, favours taking advantage of the depopulation from the war to tip the balance in Ungol favour. She actively recruits Ungols to come and live in the city, and she does her best to get them established.\\n\\nThis manoeuvring involves leaning on people to provide loans or other help and hiring freelance agents and adventurers to look into problems faced by Ungol communities or prominent individuals. She would like to see a wealthy Ungol merchant but is prepared to wait.\\n\\nInalchin, a younger hag, is more impatient and arranges accidents to tip struggling Gospodars over the edge into ruin, death, and, ideally, leaving the city. She does her best to hire non-Ungol agents for these tasks and is remarkably good at hiding her own origins. She looks on the power struggle between the guilds and boyars with barely suppressed glee and is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to fan the flames.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_praag_girl_in_glass_description	There are many legends told in both the Empire and Kislev about a beautiful girl who will save the world from Chaos if only she can be freed from her glass prison. Some stories say the girl is the Goddess Shallya, others say she is the Vampire Genevieve (a fact she fiercely denies if in earshot). In Kislev, the most famous version is the one presented in Anton Denisovich’s great opera The Girl in Glass.\\n\\nHere, the girl is the Goddess of Purity, her coffin buried under Praag, and she can only be freed by the kiss of a cursed Chaos warrior. He eventually does so due to his love for her, despite knowing she will destroy him when she is freed. The opera ends with the obliteration of the Chaos forces and the salvation of Praag and, thus, is enduringly popular in the city that has suffered so much.\\n\\nWhat is more, several unscrupulous riddle-men are playing upon this myth by offering people a glimpse of the real Girl in Glass, for a moderate fee. Any un-marred young woman visiting the city will be propositioned to join this scam, as finding appropriately goddess-like women who are prepared to lie for hours half-naked in a rusty glass box is not easy.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_praag_old_town_starograd_description	The area inside the original walls of the town is filled with the oldest buildings, packed haphazardly into tight, winding streets that all too often lead nowhere. Due to the protection of a second wall, the Old Town was spared the true horror that has consumed Novygrad but still suffered destruction and bears the marks of Chaos.\\n\\nRebuilding is slow but constant; shiny new houses mingle with those from centuries ago – modern design is found next to the thatched roofs of the Ropsmenn ghetto. Once, these streets housed Praag’s craftsmen, but as the city expanded, such things moved south, and the traders here turned to more exotic goods.\\n\\nHere, you will find the sellers of proscribed books, magic ingredients, and foreign wonders. Here, too, are the more exotic bordellos, the more specific drug dens, and the more presentable victims of mutation and madness. In the tiny street-corner cafes, men of the Old Town sing songs from better days, drink strange Cathayan beverages, and wait for the taint to kill them.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_praag_newton_novygrad_description	The area immediately surrounding the Old Town to the north and east has been known as Newtown since it was constructed eight centuries ago. Its closeness to the north gate meant that its narrow, densely housed streets were the first and hardest hit of the entire city, and no rebuilding can reclaim it.\\n\\nOnly the poorest of the poor live in these streets, for the sickness kills too quickly, and the Sunworms and Chaos Slime get the rest. The drains are scabrous sores that ooze stinking liquids, and the sickly air chokes with insects spawned endlessly from the piles of mutated corpses. The wind whispers murderous thoughts, and the muddy streets are full of deadly quicksand.\\n\\nThe law will not follow criminals here, but only the desperate or the most perverse stay long. Cultists and rebels can meet safely amongst the ruined streets, but they too leave quickly lest the price is too high – the streets could shift, and they might never find their way out. Occasionally, controlled fires and demolitions are carried out in the quarter, but the taint remains, and most residents of Praag have accepted it.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_praag_deep_city_glubograd_description	Although not on any map, everyone knows there is a city underneath that which lies on the surface. Praag is very old, and its Dwarf population built tunnels from the very beginning. More famously, during the time of Z’ra Zoltan, the area under the Citadel and the Old Town was filled with vast catacombs on the idea that when the walls broke, retreating underground might be the only escape.\\n\\nThe catacombs were never used, but apparently, great war machines and sorcerous defences were constructed and cunning devices installed to provide sun and water and food in case a siege ever lasts for years again. Z’ra Zoltan’s ice witch, Walpura, also built a great laboratory below, and legend has it she discovered some Dark Magic source far beneath the city.\\n\\nIn the devastation of the Great War, however, all entries to the true Deep were lost, and nobody goes far below any more. Deep down, the great secrets of Praag may be waiting to be discovered, but right now, survival is more important than secrets.\\n	false

To the east is the Mountain Gate, where those heading to the Worlds Edge Mountains depart. To the north is the Gate of Gargoyles, named for its numerous, vividly carved waterspouts.\\n\\nWhen the forces of Chaos blew down the north gate, the gargoyles’ faces became horrifically mutated. It is said to be very bad luck to look up when passing through the Gate of Gargoyles, for if the tainted faces of the gargoyles catch your eye, they will feast upon your soul that very night. Whether the tale is true or not is unknown, but those who glance from the corners of their eyes have noted the number of gargoyles on the gate is never the same.\\n\\nThe southernmost bridge is called Karlsbridge after Z’ra Karl the XII, the ruler who led the first secession campaign against the tyranny of the south. The bridge is wide enough for two carriages to pass alongside and is flanked by elaborate stone towers of Dwarfen design.\\n\\nTo the north lies the Empty Bridge – or the Bridge of Death. The latter name comes from the fact that it used to carry the men of the Old City across to the Citadel to become soldiers. The former name is Kislevite irony, for the bridge is never empty. Anyone who crosses it at night feels as if he is being followed. Looking behind reveals a figure cloaked in shadow that keeps coming nearer, yet never catches up.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislev_gora_geroyev_city_walls_description	Standing on the banks of the River Urskoy, Kislev is built atop the Gora Geroyev, which means “Hill of the Heroes.” Originally a burial site for fallen heroes of Kislev, the red soil of this hill is considered sacred, and it is a source of fierce pride to the city’s inhabitants that no enemy has yet breached their walls.\\n\\nThe walls of the city are tall; machicolations are cunningly wrought within the decorative gargoyles at the wall head, and smoke rises from prepared braziers on the ramparts. The precise construction of the protruding towers and gatehouses ensures every yard of rocky ground before the walls is a killing zone, covered by crossbows and cannon emplacements.\\n\\nAn attacker will pay a fearsome toll in blood to breach the city’s walls, as they are amongst the most steadfast defences of the Old World, at least the equal of Nuln or Altdorf. However, the base of the wall has a smooth, glassy look to it, as though the stone has vitrified under some intense heat.\\n\\nThis appearance is a legacy of the Great War against Chaos when the hordes of Asavar Kul laid siege to the city and caused the solid stone of the walls to run like molten wax. A cobbled roadway winds up the Gora Geroyev to a wide bridge that crosses a deep ditch and leads to the westernmost gate of the city.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislev_city_river_gates_description	Four main gates allow pedestrians and horsemen into the city of Kislev, one at each of the compass points. The westernmost gate is the Urskoy Gate, also known as the Gate of Heroes, for this is the gate through which the defenders of Kislev sallied to win the final victory against Asavar Kul in the Great War against Chaos.\\n\\nThe southern gate is known as Tor’s Gate, while the eastern gate is dedicated to Dazh, for it is the first to look upon the rising sun. The northern gate of the city is called the Zza Gate, for it leads to the north and beyond (which is the literal translation of Zza and also the word the Kislevites use when they must talk of the nightmarish Realm of Chaos).\\n\\nEach gate is constructed from studded timber banded with black iron and is warded with powerful enchantments cast by the Ice Queen to render them invulnerable to fire. Each gate is freezing to the touch, glistening with a sheen of frost, and the guards who man the gate are all equipped with thick gloves to open and close it.\\n\\nEach gate is embedded in a mighty gatehouse of thick stone and is protected by murder holes in the roof. No less than a hundred Kossars man each gatehouse, and there are many hundreds more within shouting distance.\\n\\nThe city wall is also breached by two mighty river gates, which allow river traffic in and out of the city. Each of these gates is a vast, iron portcullis that is raised and lowered by means of a Dwarfen steam-powered windlass on the walls above. During the day, the river portcullises are left open, but they are both shut at sundown and only opened again at daybreak. The mechanism of these portcullises is also guarded by detachments of Kossars.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislev_four_bridges_description	Four bridges cross the Urskoy as it winds through Kislev; three are fashioned by the hands of men and one by magic. The first bridge is the Bachór Bridge, a plain, unadorned bridge of grey stone and little ornamentation that takes its name from the unruly men who work on the docks.\\n\\nThis bridge marks the beginning of Kislev’s docks, which are known as the Dokziema area of the city. It also effectively marks the territory of the various dockhands and stevedores, who run things in this part of the city with a ruthless, if crooked, efficiency. Any person of quality – or those who simply don’t wish to be robbed or murdered – avoid the Dokziema area, for it is a nest of cutthroats and vagabonds.\\n\\nThe second bridge is known locally as the Blyad Bridge, due to the fact that at its northern end is Madame Katya’s Quilted Palm, a house of ill repute. The bridge is of Dwarfen construction and is solid and embellished with many fine carvings; although in recent years, a wooden hoarding has been added to make it a covered bridge, perhaps to spare the blushes of the furtive figures that can be seen crossing the bridge on their way to Madame Katya’s den of iniquity. Though there is sure to be someone who remembers the bridge’s original name, most Kislevites prefer its current name.\\n\\nThe Dorogo Bridge takes its name from one of the old names for the city and is a magnificent ironwork bridge that allows the great triumphal road of the Urskoy Prospekt to cross the river towards the Bokha Palace. Constructed in 2411 IC in a joint venture between engineers from the Dwarfhold Karaz-a-Karak and Humans from the Altdorf College of Engineers, the bridge has pneumatic pistons that allow its span to be raised and lowered from the northern bank.\\n\\nThe final bridge is known as the Queen’s Bridge and is a glittering bridge of solid ice that spans the Urskoy before it reaches the eastern wall of the city. Created by the Ice Queen to replace the original bridge after it was destroyed by a lucky Hellcannon shot during the latest siege, it links the Koztowny area and the Merkantlny district of the city. It is a breathtakingly beautiful sculpture of ice that never melts, even in the height of summer, and though it is formed of ice, no footing is surer in Kislev.\\n	false

Hundreds of tonnes of man and animal waste flow through the sewers below the streets of Kislev, carried through oval tunnels dug through the rock and earth of the Gora Geroyev to empty downriver into the Urskoy.\\n\\nThe sewers are known to be a haunt of those whose dealings are best conducted away from inquisitive eyes on the surface, and it is a well-worn expression in Kislev that when someone “stinks like a river of dung,” they are up to no good or that goods are suspect. The original blueprints of the tunnel system may exist somewhere in the Bokha Palace, but if they do, none now know exactly where.\\n	false

Each shard of ice sparkles like a diamond, and though there is no jet to spray the ice or bowl to catch them in, they magically disappear before they touch the ground.\\n\\nThe beautiful fountain spins slowly in the air, rainbows of light arcing through the tiny, falling splinters of ice.

The inside of the theatre is deathly cold, but far from putting off potential theatregoers, it only seems to heighten its downmarket chic.\\n\\nAll manner of theatrical events are put on here, and even travelling players may tread the boards in Korotovsky’s theatre. There have been numerous attempts to repair the theatre; many of its rich clientele wish to see it restored to its former glory (mainly because they don’t like such a dilapidated building in the centre of the Koztowny district).\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislev_lubjanko_description	Following the Great War against Chaos, Tzar Alexis was horrified by the care the wounded soldiers had received and immediately commissioned the construction of a hospital against the eastern wall of the city. Too many men had died needlessly of their wounds, and Alexis had been determined Kislev would boast the finest facility for the treatment of injuries in all the Old World.\\n\\nFor a time, the imposing Lubjanko building served to house those wounded and traumatised by the horrors of war, but before long, it became a dumping ground for the sick, the deranged, and the crippled. Entire floors are now dedicated to the process of dying, where the mortally wounded are left to rot away the last miserable hours of their lives.\\n\\nThe Lubjanko is now a magnet for all manner of dispossessed unfortunates; orphans, homeless, the diseased, the crippled, and the mad. All come to rest within its walls, and its black stone facade and high, spike-topped walls serve as a grim reminder of the fate of those who have fallen between the cracks. Mothers quiet unruly children by threatening to cast them within its brooding, nightmarish walls and injured soldiers pray to the Gods that they be spared the Lubjanko.\\n\\nNight around the Lubjanko is a time to be feared. The howls of the lunatics and dying within its fortress walls fill the air with their cacophonous ravings. As such, it is a shunned place, the derelict buildings and empty streets around it deserted, and even criminals do not frequent the echoing prospekts around the death-house of the Lubjanko. Only those about some particularly dark business would dare the haunted shadows that gather about it, and even then, they hurry to complete their business rather than linger.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kislev_akshina_building_description	Most rulers have their own network of spies and informants, but none are as feared as the Akshina of Kislev. The saying goes that what the Akshina deem as law is the law. The fortress-like headquarters of Kislev’s feared enforcers is a grim building surrounded by a high wall with only one entrance through a heavy black gate.\\n\\nBeyond this gate is a bare, cobbled courtyard and an austere, windowless building of grey stone with but a single black door at its centre. Within the building lies torture and death for the enemies of the Tzarina or those that conspire to worship the Dark Gods. Armoured in distinctive black uniforms, the Akshina are universally dreaded by all citizens of Kislev, for once a person enters their lair, they are known as “disappeared” and will, in all likelihood, never be seen alive again.\\n\\nBeneath the building, a narrow brickwork passageway leads down to the grim dungeons; flickering lamplight illuminates walls that have seen countless miseries and now bleed those horrors into the air like a curse. Flaking paint coats the walls, and old bloodstains are splashed across the brickwork.\\n\\nAt the end of the passageway is a solid iron door with a mesh grille set at eye level that leads into the cells. Beyond this door is a wide, straw-covered gallery that stretches off into darkness, the brick walls pierced at regular intervals by narrow doors of rusted iron; the stench of stale sweat, human waste, and fear hangs heavy in the air. To be consigned to the dungeons of the Akshina is to be condemned to a short life of misery and death.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_the_akshina_description	The Akshina are the Tzarina’s secret police. Their existence is not secret, and they have a lot of open members, but they also have spies searching for signs of corruption and opposition to Katarin’s rule.\\n\\nThe Akshina are – by decree of the Tzarina – infallible in their interpretation of the law. Whatever they say is the law, is the law, and the penalties they select are always appropriate to the crime in question. They never convict the wrong people, and while they may arrest and torture people who prove to be innocent, that is no fault of the Akshina.\\n\\nThe most important qualification for becoming an Akshina is absolute loyalty to the Tzarina, which is closely followed by competence. Katarin does not want to institute a reign of terror; she just wants to be able to deal with her enemies quickly and efficiently. Akshina who display excessive cruelty and incompetence are arrested by their superiors and soon become even more closely acquainted with the furnishings of the interrogation rooms. The simply incompetent generally die in the course of their duty, without any assistance from their superiors.\\n\\nAkshina who are sadistic but competent pose the biggest problem. In most cases, they are rotated around the country, so that no single area suffers too much from their depredations. Often, they are assigned to deal with very dangerous threats because the hierarchy would rather lose a difficult Akshina than one who fits in perfectly.\\n\\nThe Akshina carry an elaborate, minted medallion identifying their position and show it if required to prove who they are. They wear black when on duty but have no formal uniform beyond that, making it relatively easy to pose as a member of the secret police. The Akshina deal with anyone who pretends to be one of them, which is another task frequently assigned to those who are both sadistic and competent.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_gospodars_description	The powerful and wealthy Gospodars primarily inhabit the southern areas of Kislev. Almost all of the ruling elite, including the Tzars and Tzarinas, come from Gospodar stock, and their language and beliefs dominate Kislevite society.\\n\\nIn particular, the Gospodar Cult of Ursun the Bear was the most powerful religion in Kislev, influencing even most Ungol communities, before being subsumed by the Great Orthodoxy. Gospodar women, who are renowned throughout the Old World for their fair-skinned beauty, are afforded the same rights as men, which can be confusing to outsiders unfamiliar to such equality.\\n\\nThe Gospodars are a tall, imposing folk with fine features that can seem exotic and strange to foreigners. Their skin is usually pale, though those wandering the oblast will be as weathered as any Ungol tribesman, and their often-straight hair ranges from blue-black to reds and blondes. Some blessed babes are born with white or silver hair, which is believed to be a sign the land’s spirits have marked the child for great deeds.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_ungols_description	The less-populous Ungols predominantly live in the north. Their settlements reach deep into the dangerous Troll Country, where they were driven long ago by the Gospodars. Nomadic krugs of Ungol horsemen wander the oblast as far as Black Blood Pass, and some have more in common with marauding kyazak than with other Kislevites.\\n\\nThey are a spiritual people with a long and proud history, and they have their own language – though it is slowly dying out. Ungol women have the same rights as men, and some nomadic krugs are entirely matriarchal.\\n\\nThere is a marked difference between the noble Gospodar peoples in the south and their less refined kin in the north. Ungols, as a people, are squat and hardy, thick of bone and heavily muscled. Grown tough in the harsh clime of their lands, they are accustomed to cruel weather and can withstand all but the worst of storm.\\n\\nUngols typically have angular features and heavy-lidded eyes. Their mouths tend to sit in a frown, giving them a taciturn cast to their faces. Ungols have swarthy skin, tough and leathery on their hands and faces, and dark eyes. Their hair is thick, coarse and almost always black.\\n\\nAs the Ungols dwell nearest to the flesh-warping regions of the Shadowlands, many Ungols have mixed blood, finding in their veins the blood of Gospodars and Ropsmenn, but also Norse and Kurgan. As a result, lighter colouring is not unknown and there have been more than a few Ungols with queer red hair and green or blue eyes. Indeed, with the ravaging tribes of the extreme north, many Ungols sport hair or eye colours, or even builds that are utterly unlike any of their kin.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_ursun_description	Ursun is the God of Bears, also known as Father of Bears, or Father Bear. His worship was first introduced by the Gospodars, but bears are such a major part of Kislevite life that the religion was absorbed almost instantly.\\n\\nBears continue to be a vital part of society to this day, and the religion is now inseparable from the Kislevite culture. Worship of Ursun is not a state religion as the worship of Sigmar in the Empire is, but the fate of Kislev is linked in many minds to the fortunes and favour of Father Bear.\\n\\nUrsun is usually depicted as a giant, brown, cave bear, sometimes wearing a gold crown. He also often has golden teeth or golden claws, which indicate not only that Ursun is king of the beasts but the value of bears as well. On the oblast, a killed bear will provide great wealth to an entire stanitsa.\\n\\nOccasionally, Ursun is depicted as a large, burly man with grey streaks in his wild hair. He wears a loincloth and carries nothing but a spear. As a wild God, Ursun is not worshipped in temples but in outdoor shrines or disused bear caves. In the cities, great gardens of pine trees, bushes, and rocks serve as a place of worship, the shrine hidden in a cave or cleft in the centre. The greatest of these gardens sits near the Bokha Palace in Kislev.	false

gen_lore_ksl_dazh_description	When the world was first made, it was all in darkness and ice. Dazh saw this and took pity on man. He took his great horse and bore his fire across the sky, giving light to the world. Afterwards, Dazh returned to his golden sky-palace to rest, for the ride was long and tiring. However, he saw the people below were cold and afraid without his fire, yet he could not ride out again until his horse was rested. So Dazh gave the gift of fire to mankind, so they might have some of his light at all times.\\n\\nDazh is depicted as a handsome young man with golden hair and shining eyes, his body wreathed in fire. Dazh is so dazzling it is impossible to look upon him without being blinded. Thus, if Dazh needs to communicate, he sends his firebirds or the Arari as messengers. The Arari are great fire spirits that dwell in Dazh’s golden palace. When they are not serving him, they often dance, producing a colourful display in the northern sky.\\n\\nDazh is the kindest of all the Kislev Gods and the one most concerned with man’s welfare. In return, he places a great emphasis on proper behaviour. The followers of Dazh are the most dedicated of all the Kislevite priests, and their ceremonies are the most formalised.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_tor_description	Ursun is the most revered God of Kislev, but Tor is the most omnipresent. He has no real cult, no particular day or time of worship, few temples, no orders, and only one stricture, but Tor has little need for such things. Tor is part of life.\\n\\nWhen the sky shakes, and the earth trembles, there is Tor. When the lightning flashes, the thunder rolls, the wind screams, and hail lashes the ground like a horsewhip, there is Tor. He is in the thunder of hooves, too, and the flash of steel, for Tor is a warrior God as well as a sky God. As so much of Kislevite life is nought but battle and war, Tor is a constant companion, and no axeman goes into the fray without uttering a prayer to him.\\n\\nTor is depicted as a mighty warrior, with rippling muscles and a square jaw. He wields a gigantic axe with a haft made of oak and a great, silvered blade. It is this axe he slams into the ground to make the lightning and the thunder and to send courage to his faithful. Tor is also the God of courage, as well as stoic resilience in the face of trial, regardless of if that trial is weathering a furious storm or weathering the charge of a Daemon of Chaos.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_ulric_taal_subtitle	Ulric and Taal	false
gen_lore_ksl_ulric_taal_description	The border between the Empire and Kislev is ill-defined and equally so is the divide between their cultures. Although Ulric and Taal were the Gods of southern tribes, their faith has spread to the north, and their attitudes and domains are a natural fit with the dour Kislevites. Although they are not as popular as Ursun or Tor, these cults are significant in Kislevite culture and politics.\\n\\nWorship of Taal is common throughout the south, especially along the river that shares the God’s name. The Ungol tribes of the north pay homage to forest spirits and have no need for a forest God. Perhaps because farming is too difficult in the Empty Quarter, few believe in the generosity of Mother Rhya, and she is seen as a minor adjunct to Taal, not his equal.\\n\\nApart from this, worship of Taal is exactly the same as it is in the Empire, though the Empire’s followers escape the jurisdiction of the Great Orthodoxy. Kislev counts as its own region, ruled over by a single hierarch, a tall Empire-born figure known only as Oster. He presides over a great stone circle in the Shirokij Forest, near the capital, and smaller shrines can be found throughout the land.\\n\\nKislevite priests of Taal gain all the spells of the Lore of Taal and Rhya, though they know Rhya’s comfort as Taal’s strength. Taal is also never depicted as a bear in Kislevite cults – when he takes animal form, it is always as a great stag or reindeer.\\n\\nAs mentioned, Ulric shares much with Ursun, and many a hunter or trapper prays to the former to keep the wolves at bay and the latter to keep the bears away. The Cult of Ulric is mostly confined to the south, but many a southern stanitsa has a statue of a wolf next to a statue of a bear. The wolf is seen as the bear’s young rival—not as smart or as strong but still worthy of respect and is a good source of food and pelts.\\n\\nUlric’s warrior nature also makes him appealing to the Kislevites, and he is most popular among the soldiers of the south, worshipped alongside Tor. Soldiers may offer a prayer to Tor for courage and to Ulric for strength without skipping a beat. There is also a saying that a good officer must be “bold as Tor, cold as Ulric.”\\n\\nAs a result, there a several temples of Ulric throughout the south, and his holy days are observed regularly. The Knights of the White Wolf even have a great company based in Erengrad called the Knights of the White Star. The Order of the Howling Wolf is not common in Kislev; Kislevites have little need for the “talking priests” found in the Empire.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_salyak_description	Salyak is the Kislevite God of healing and comfort and bears much in common with Shallya of the Empire. Like Shallya, Salyak is depicted as a woman in white or a white bird, and those of her order are charged to tend to the sick whenever possible. Salyak is more of a mother of mercy than a maiden, however, and intercedes less than her Empire counterpart. Salyak teaches common sense and sound care but will not save those whose time has come.\\n\\nMost prayers to Salyak come from young mothers and nursemaids. Salyak knows how to calm a baby to sleep, how to make sure he eats and sleeps well, and watches over him to make sure he grows up to be a great warrior. Salyak also knows how to dull the pain or remove a shattered limb when the boy grows up and comes back from battle. “Salyak’s Mercy” is the name of a drink given to dying soldiers; it is a mix of koumiss, mandrake, and hemlock that ensures they die quickly and without pain.\\n\\nTemples to Salyak are mostly found in cities, where there is some access to the requirements of her ministrations and some chance of them working. Uniquely for Kislev, Salyak’s priests can be either male or female. In general, the males tend to the soldiers, while the females work as nursemaids. Some say the priestesses of Salyak are responsible for raising the next generation of Kislev’s warriors and, thus, are vital to the land holding out against Chaos.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_kalita_description	Kalita is the Kislevite approximation of Handrich, the Empire God of merchants and money. However, since gold is the metal of Dazh and silver of Tor, Kalita is associated less with money and more with trade goods and materials. His symbol is the horse or the pony, laden with barrels and crates. Kalita watches over caravans and trade routes, ensuring the goods reach their destination, the roads are not closed by blizzards, and the wheels of commerce continue to turn – something not at all reliable in the harsh climate of the north.\\n\\nKalita is only worshipped in the cities and even then only by merchants. He has no temples or any real cult to speak of, and he is only remembered by small symbols or statues on the desks and walls of the counting houses and guildhalls.\\n\\nHe is usually depicted as a wealthy, young nobleman and is considered a member of Dazh’s court. He appeals to Dazh to hold the snows or darkness at bay for that extra hour or day of travel. Sometimes he is successful; sometimes he is not. Thus, the saying “to trust in Kalita” implies a risky business venture.\\n	false

Those touched by the Ruinous Powers are ready-made spies and traitors. Whenever the taint is manifested, the wise women – thanks to the Sight – can see it and take action. They take the tainted away to the oblast, and he disappears from the knowledge of the village.\\n\\nThe taint normally manifests in children soon after birth, and parents give their children up without protest. But they don’t necessarily like it. While they might admit it is not the fault of the wise women their child is a Mutant, it is hard to avoid blaming the people who actually take your child from you.\\n\\nIt is even harder when the taint is not visible and something only the wise women can see. Gospodars often protest in those circumstances, and sometimes, the wise women must resort to stealth to remove the threat from the village.\\n	false

Her mistress died during her training – frozen solid by the magic she was trying to teach her apprentice – so Vajena was never fully educated in the ways of the sisterhood. Since this time, Vajena has given into the frigid magic and has become cold, harsh, and unfeeling. She allows none to trespass in her land and has even killed two Ice Witches who investigated her territory.\\n\\nKazahaila Yevschenko\\nAfter fifty strict years maintaining Frosthome and a score of apprentices, the noble-born Kazahaila disappeared in the oblast over twenty years ago. However, when Erengrad, the city of her birth, was sacked, rumours circulated that the uncompromising witch had returned. If true, she would be at least a hundred years old, so many of her old opponents dismiss the claims as ridiculous; however, the rumours persist, and as Kazahaila was always an opponent of the bloodlines from Kislev city, she could prove to be a difficult thorn in the Ice Queen’s side.\\n\\nDaryna Borinado Bokha\\nRumours circulate of witches lost to the ice, unfortunates driven insane by the Ancient Widow’s frozen magic. When the Ice Queen sent messengers to check on the progress of her young cousin, Daryna, they encountered a horrific scene. Even though it was summer, the isolated palace and all its lands were frozen solid, along with the ice witch responsible for Daryna’s training. The girl was never found, and some claim if she ever is – and is harmed – the Ice Queen’s wrath would be terrible to behold.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_matryoshka_description	Matryoshka, or Kislevite nesting dolls, were originally made by the Ungols to protect against evil spirits. A newly married woman was gifted a hollow, wooden doll by her husband. At the birth of their first child, the husband sawed the doll in two and placed a smaller doll within.\\n\\nAt the birth of their second child, the smaller doll was sawed in half, and a doll representing the second child was placed within, and so on. It was believed the dolls, as long as they were intact and together, would attract evil spirits in the place of their counterparts.\\n\\nAlthough the tradition has died in most parts of Kislev, the dolls are still made, but they are now mostly decorative. One matryoshka typically has one “mother” and eight “children,” each beautifully painted in bright colours. The Ice Queen is said to have been presented with a six-foot matryoshka representing her entire nation upon her coronation, containing 1,000 progressively smaller dolls within.\\n	false

I’ll not forget that in a hurry!\\n\\n– Gottri Half-Hammer, Dwarf Merchant\\n\\nThe word kvas translates as “sour milk” and is, after water, the most popular drink in Kislev. It is a drink that transcends the normal distinctions of class that hold sway over all other aspects of Kislevite society. Peasants drink it with gusto, and nobles prefer it to the weak southern wines and brandies brought by foreigners.\\n\\nSuch is the Kislevite fondness for kvas, that it is used in almost every aspect of life, from cooking (where it serves as stock for many daily dishes) to medicine (where it is credited for saving many peasants from scurvy during times of famine). Its curative powers are also said to extend to colds, dropsy, fever, and diseases of the intestines, but whether this can be attributed to the kvas or the Kislevites’ legendary constitution from drinking the stuff will likely never be known.\\n\\nThere are many recipes for kvas, each stanitsa claiming that it has the definitive recipe and that all others are “like drinking yellow snow,” but in general, they have the same ingredients, just in different proportions. Kvas is made from malt, rye, or wheat flour and boiling water. This dense mass is blended until the village hetman declares it is ready; then it’s put in a heated oven for a day and night. Afterwards, it is dissolved in water and left in a room for a few hours before being poured into wineskins. The strength of kvas varies from place to place (as does the flavour) for, as Kislevites are fond of saying, there are as many different types of kvas as grass on the steppe.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_empire_heartwood_description	Kislev’s vast forested plains make wood abundantly available to rural settlements in the frontier oblasts, who often use it for everything; from buildings and sleds to cutlery and statues of the Kislevite gods. Simple yet ingenious interlocking joinery means that nails aren’t required when building, so construction is quite cheap and fast.\\n\\nThis is naturally a good thing since making all of your buildings out of wood does have one drawback: fire, less because of flammability in the frozen conditions and more because it makes it easier for Norscan marauders to burn an entire village to the ground. So these rapid construction techniques are needed if a burned village is to quickly rebuild, year after year, time and again.\\n\\nThankfully, the forests are dense in Kislev, meaning that there is no shortage of wood. However certain hallowed sites contain the best heartwoods and trees said to be blessed by Ursun’s urine. The wood from such forests are said to be as strong as stone and burn resistant, but they also hold a certain cultural and spiritual significance as well.\\n	false

Such untamed wealds are protected by the acolytes of Mother Ostankya and their spirit allies from the incursions of Beastmen, Daemons, Chaos worshippers and the fanatics of the Great Orthodoxy’s Dazh sect.\\n\\nHowever, Mother Ostankya’s acolytes often give leave to Kossars, Woodsmen and Hunters to harvest the forest’s bounty... so long as they heed their advice and seek no harm to Kislev. Stout heartwoods, fresh meat, rare herbs, the furs of animals and a sanctuary against the followers of the dark gods can all be found in these mystical forests.\\n\\nMother Ostankya herself is said to be an Ungol Hag Mother who is rumoured to live in Duklys Forest. The stories around her call Mother Ostankya a protector of the Motherland, and that only those who wish to harm the land need fear her.\\n\\nWhile some dismiss her very existence as a local myth, Supreme Patriarch Kostaltyn, leader of the still young Great Orthodoxy, had men search the forest for her hags. Although the witches remained elusive, enough witness testimonies, given under “a certain amount of duress”, were gathered for the Supreme Patriarch to consider her a very real threat to the nation.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the Orthodoxy’s attempts to find Mother Ostankya or their rampant logging of her forests to build more churches are not exactly endearing them towards her. No shortage of Patriarchs have found themselves hanging from the end of a branch, or tied down to a rock outside a bear den.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_tallow_keepers_guild_description	Tallow is a hard fatty substance made from rendered animal fat, used in making candles and soap, as well as used as lubrication for machines and as an oil for greasing guns. However, it is the manufacturing of tallow into candles which is most common in the icy lands of Kislev, as collecting and fashioning tallow is important in a nation that spends many months in the dark. Unsurprisingly, the Tallow-keepers guild is therefore the primary supplier of candles in Kislev and has close ties with the Cult of Dazh, worshippers of the God of Fire.\\n\\nTallow candles burn fitfully and give off an acrid stench. Wax candles meanwhile might burn cleaner than tallow ones, and are sometimes scented, but this added feature usually increases the price threefold. For this reason, most of the lower classes of Kislev have to make do with the locally made tallow candles, whilst the nobility are able to import and enjoy wax candles imported from the Empire.\\n\\nLegend has it that there was an attempt by a previous Tzarina of Kislev to implement a Tallow-tax; however, this tax proved so unpopular that it was repealed within two hours of its implementation after revolts immediately began breaking out across the city districts.\\n	false

gen_lore_ksl_on_the_wild_side_description	Kislev’s cold forests are inhabited by many creatures with thick and durable coats. Small mammals such as ermine, fox, and squirrel are hunted as part of the booming fur trade. But the most prized fur is sable and Snow Leopard. Desired for its deep colours, softness and scarcity, it can fetch a princely sum when brought to market.\\n\\nThe Snow Leopard has been declared sacred by the Ice Court. Therefore, their fur is only harvested when one dies of natural causes. Inevitably, their fur is an incredibly rare commodity.\\n\\nPoachers from the Empire and the Karaz Ankor have taken advantage of this artificial scarcity, illegally hunting the beasts and selling the fur to Kislevites at an exorbitant cost. Those who are found to be engaging in this practice, as either buyer or seller, are quickly executed, and are often frozen solid by the Frost Maidens themselves.\\n\\nHowever, there is no creature more important to the Kislevites than the Bear. He is more than just the symbol of the land, a God, and a king; his image is more than just a rallying figure for armies and proud citizens. The bear shares his life with the people of the oblast and shares their struggles. When winters are harsh, he goes hungry just as they do. When spring comes again, he takes his young to the river to play just as they do.\\n\\nIn summer’s bloom, he trains his young to hunt, and he hunts as well as any man. The only difference is that the bear hunts men, and men hunt the bear. Despite this, the bear is not an enemy so much as a healthy competitor. It is right to be wary of the bear and fight to drive him back to his own lands should he come out of the forest or caves – but so, too, will the bear fight to protect his home, and so, too, is he wary of the rifle, the blade, and the bow.\\n\\nIt is Kislevite tradition to hang furs and pelts from the very same caves and dens that once housed the bears that supplied them. This is both a mark of respect and a warning to other hunters to watch out for any other bears that might take up residence in their cousin’s former home.\\n	false

They are also a prominent export, with nations from as far south as Tilea eager to acquire the nation’s renowned materials. With paying customers both locally and abroad, the Tanners Guild are quite wealthy and well connected amongst the nobility.\\n\\nKislevite leather is a particular form of bark-tanned cow leather. It is distinguished from other types by a processing step that takes place after tanning, where oil is worked into the rear face of the leather. This produces a leather that is hard-wearing, flexible and resistant to water and insect damage. The end result is a high quality product that is useful for a range of purposes and difficult to replicate elsewhere.\\n\\nFur, however, remains the most in demand item of the Tanners Guild. There are several methods utilised to acquire pelts: purchase, confiscation, hunting expeditions, rare trade with Norscans, and, more recently, domestication of the most sought after furbearers. Kislevite furs have been used to make a wide range of products, with clothing being the most common.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_marks_of_chaos_description	A Mark of Chaos is a sign of favour from one of the Ruinous Powers, often bestowed upon a loyal subject. It is a brand connecting the person to his foul deity, and an outward sign of his devotion.\\n\\nMarks of Chaos can come in many different shapes, styles, or designs, but are clearly associated with their Ruinous Power and often the actual symbol of that god. Here are just a few examples.\\n\\nA Mark of Tzeentch may manifest as a pulsing blue Chaos Star, a raven tattoo that appears to be flying across the subject’s skin, or a sinuous, writhing flame emblazoned on the subject’s back. A Mark of Nurgle may be a distended boil oozing foetid pus, an open sore weeping a stream of maggots, or a pox-marked patch of vaguely green-tinted skin that constantly sheds and peels.\\n\\nA Mark of Khorne may change the marked person’s eyes to a deep, blood red. It may manifest as a dark red battle scar still wet with crimson blood, or a skull-shaped knob or deformity on the marked one’s flesh. A Mark of Slaanesh may be a subtle, intoxicating scent of musk lingering on the person, a slightly dreamy, purplish tinge to the marked one’s lips, eyes, and hair, or the growth of additional nipples.\\n\\nFollowers of the same Ruinous Power have an uncanny intuition, allowing them to sense when someone bearing their deity’s mark is nearby. Bearers of a Mark of Chaos usually go to great lengths to hide it from non-believers, as recognition of such a sign is a death sentence, sure to draw the attention of Witch Hunters, angry mobs, or worse.	false

gen_lore_chs_path_to_glory_description	Chaos Champions are forever searching for more power, and with it, the chance to attract the eye of the gods. They roam the Realm of Chaos and beyond to seek out artefacts and monsters to bind to their will. These champions are constantly hunting out rivals and great duels are fought, with the victor often claiming the slain warrior’s followers as his own.\\n\\nAs a champion’s infamy and power grows, others flock to his banner, seeing in him an individual who can lead them to ever greater glories, and the chance to earn glory for themselves. Just as the weak-willed tribesmen of the north are drawn to the champions of Chaos, they in turn are lured to the sides of the greatest Chaos Lords. In this way, the warbands of Chaos grow ever larger until they are consumed in the fires of war or internal conflict tears them asunder.\\n\\nJust like the Dark Gods themselves, the mortal followers of Chaos are driven to war amongst themselves. However, they are able to set aside their differences to unite with, or manipulate, the warriors of other gods if it furthers their own ambitions and fight against the world.\\n\\nTo this end, there is no pact that cannot be forged; a Champion of Khorne will seek a bargain with Tzeentch’s Sorcerers if it will ensure the blood of his enemies flows. The natural enmity and selfishness of the Champions of Chaos means that such alliances are fragile though and can be unmade in the blink of an eye, mortals and gods turning on each other without warning.	false

gen_lore_chs_gifts_of_the_gods_description	The rewards of the Chaos Gods take many and bizarre forms. A champion may be blessed with great strength and fortitude, or his flesh may start to mutate; his limbs twisting into razor claws and his skin growing as tough as Dragon scale.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for the gods to grant their champions a vile unity with their weapons and armour. Their swords become as much a part of their body as their hands, and their armour melds to their flesh as a second skin that can never be removed.\\n\\nTo onlookers, this is a sign of great favour, for the champion has metamorphosed into a warrior true, his body an indomitable fusion of mutant claws, steel and sinew. Clad for war and war alone, these warriors are amongst the most battle-hungry of all the scions of the north. Only the bearer of such a gift knows the pain and isolation that such gifts entail, and the despair of being trapped within a cage so complete that death is the only escape.\\n\\nThe ultimate reward that a Champion of Chaos can receive is to be made immortal: to become a Daemon Prince whose body swells with arcane energies and whose desires can be indulged within the Realm of Chaos for all eternity. For the less fortunate aspirant, the final reward for selling his soul is an unmarked grave upon some corpse-strewn battlefield, his cadaver pecked clean by the crows.\\n\\nYet a grisly death is not the worst fate that one who has trod the path of Chaos can suffer, for the Dark Gods are inhuman and whimsical, and they make no distinction between a beneficial or disadvantageous gift. Even the most vaunted Chaos Lord can find himself disfigured in an instant, his body wracked by a multitude of debilitating mutations.\\n\\nShould the gods continue to pile on their dubious gifts, the recipient will devolve into a mindless, hideous creature known as a Chaos Spawn. Though a god may turn his champion into a Spawn if they have displeased him in some way, he is just as likely to do so simply as a result of inadvertently heaping one mutation upon another.\\n\\nThough their forms are repulsive, these gibbering once-men are revered by the followers of Chaos, for they believe that it is better to know the briefest and most vile of existences at the behest of the gods than to grow old without drawing their notice.	false

gen_lore_chs_the_dark_tongue_description	In the hidden and secret realms of the north, men clad in robes of darkness mutter the vile syllables known as the Dark Tongue. The most gifted of shamans and sorcerers use it to summon and bind the forces that exist beyond the veil.\\n\\nThe Dark Tongue is a ritual language and the only manner in which the mysteries of Chaos can truly be expressed. It is the language of Daemons and Chaos creatures which have the power of speech. Daemon names and the secret daemonic names of the most elevated Chaos Champions can only be spoken in the Dark Tongue, and the servants of Chaos learn to speak and write it for the conjuration of Chaos entities and to bargain with Daemons when they are summoned.\\n\\nThe tribes that live under the shadow of Chaos have their own languages and dialects, just like the nations of the Old World. Many of these languages incorporate elements of the Dark Tongue, particularly in holy rituals and important ceremonies. When bastardised in this fashion, the Dark Tongue loses much of its potency, but still the knowledge that these barbaric peoples have is sufficient to make their sacrifices dangerous affairs.\\n\\nThe Dark Tongue in the written form is a series of phonetic runes, each letter form representing a vocalised sound. As a written language, the Dark Tongue has far less powerful properties than when spoken, hence the practise of many magic users writing their spells into tomes and grimoires.\\n\\nIt is only when these words are spoken out loud that they take on their full dimension and their power is restored. This also makes translation difficult, because no two wizards will use exactly the same runes to represent the same word sounds.\\n\\nAttempting to read another sorcerer’s text and mispronouncing a ritual or spell can have hideous and usually fatal consequences. Chaos runes writhe with a power of their own, and to look upon them at length can bring nausea, sickness and madness. It is because of this that many banners of Chaos bear such runes, to dismay and confuse the enemy.	false

gen_lore_chs_the_dread_art_description	Chaos is the root of all magic in the world. The mystic winds that blow from the Northern Wastes provide the power for Wizards and Sorcerers of all races to channel into spells. Chaos Sorcerers use this power in its rawest form, drawing it straight from the Realm of Chaos where the Winds of Magic spill into the world.\\n\\nThe magic they channel is powerful but dangerous to wield, more so than any other kind, as it irrevocably changes all those who deal with its corrupting essence. Only those with true willpower and strength of purpose can become accomplished with Chaos magic, for such contact brings about not only physical mutation, but also affects the sanity of the wizard, causing hysteria, paranoia, delusions and self-destructive megalomania.\\n\\nIn the time before the coming of the Elves and Dwarfs, the Old Ones ruled the globe. Their powers of magic verged on the godlike, and with it they shaped the continents and created the different races. But when catastrophe struck and the spatial gates at the poles of the world collapsed, the source of their power was rent open and raw Chaos spilled into the world.\\n\\nAll magic users must tap into this source of magical energy for their power, but the Sorcerers of Chaos can use it in its raw form, binding it to their will with daemonic pacts and unholy prayers to their powerful gods. Chaos magic is highly destructive, drawing upon the Winds of Death and Shadows more than any other. Those truly gifted in the magical arts, those whose patron powers have bestowed gifts of knowledge and strength upon them, can further mould the Winds of Magic in more elaborate fashions.\\n\\nThe Sorcerers of Nurgle use magic to pervert and corrupt nature, inflicting hideous magical diseases which cannot be cured. They can twist the bodies of their opponents and cause delirium in their foes, chuckling as each new pestilence takes hold.\\n\\nMore subtle are the practitioners of the Lore of Slaanesh. Suggestion, mind-altering illusions and spells of domination are their weapons, for Slaanesh delights in turning friend against friend in the name of excess.\\n\\nMost powerful and feared of all are the dread Sorcerers of Tzeentch. These warrior-wizards are master spellcasters, for all the knowledge in the world is theirs to be had should they please their master. Tzeentch Sorcerers can channel the raw colours of magic, unleashing mutating flames, moulding body and mind into strange new forms and ripping apart the enemy with blazes of iridescent power.	false

Heading south, they eventually came across the desert realm of Araby.\\n\\nThough the northmen numbered less than a hundred and the armies of Araby were many thousands strong, the Warriors of Chaos carved a path of conquest across the land. The Emirs of those far-off kingdoms sent sentient winds and fiery spirits, but to their despair the followers of Khorne grew more determined with every battle.\\n\\nThe trail that the invaders hacked through the armies sent to oppose them was marked with spatter and pools of blood that, as the days of battle grew long, ran together between the dunes as rivulets of crimson. The Emirs sent their elite bodyguards and cavalry regiments against the indomitable Chaos Warrior footsoldiers, but to no avail. The Warriors of Chaos fought with a berserk fury, and soon the rivulets became a stream.\\n\\nIn desperation, the Emirs sent gigantic beasts of war and armies that hid the dunes with their number. It was not long before the stream had become a river. Though every northman was eventually killed, their master Khorne was truly pleased, and the Crimson River flows through Araby to this day in testament to their sacrifice.	false

A secret coven of Slaanesh worshippers had blossomed within Gunthold’s fortress, and they ensured that his victory feast was lavish as it was premature.\\n\\nThe endless supply of exotic sweetmeats and potent liquor, combined with wild music and displays of abandon from the dancing girls, had a narcotic effect upon Gunthold’s men. As the air filled with the heady musk of indulgence, the captains joined the revelry in every way that they could.\\n\\nBefore long, all of the celebrants writhed naked upon the feasthall floor in the manner of beasts. Outside, at a sign from one of the coven of Slaanesh worshippers, the Chaos Warriors that had approached the fortress broke through the leaderless defenders with contemptuous ease.\\n\\nTheir target was the Feast Hall. When the Chosen of Slaanesh broke open the doors and fell upon the revellers, the ensuing orgy of bloodletting was truly epic.

Though the Elven defenders of that realm took a heavy toll, there still remained bloated Chaos Warriors impervious to their arrows. Worse still, the outermost trees of wood had begun to sicken and die, crumbling to mulch in a matter of days.\\n\\nAs the Wood Elves retreated to the verdant heart of the Ancient Wood, the enraged forest spirits of Ithilis took the fight to the Chaos Warriors choking the life from their realm. The forest spirits pushed back the invaders to the edge of the wood, but could pursue them no further.\\n\\nKhul did not give up, however. The dread poxes and plagues that he carried with him in seven wax-sealed jars were released into the forest upon fly-choked winds, and within a single day every sentient creature that made its home in the Elder Wood had been brought to its knees by hideous illness.\\n\\nThe defenders were faced with a simple choice: fight or die. A great battle took place upon the outskirts of the Elder Wood, but as the forest itself began to crumble, the dread warriors of Nurgle cut down its plague-stricken defenders.

gen_lore_chs_tzeentch_description	Tzeentch is the Changer of the Ways, and he is flux embodied. He has a masterly comprehension of magic, but also destiny, intrigue, history and subterfuge. As change is inherent in the essence of Chaos itself, Tzeentch has a strong claim to ultimate power over all who worship Chaos. For without transformation, a warrior cannot ascend to greatness, the gods cannot bestow their gifts, and the living cannot die.\\n\\nThe entity that men worship as Tzeentch has a thousand names and faces. Known as Tchar among the barbarians of the far north, Chen or Chi'an Chi in the exotic east and Shunch in the steaming jungles of the south, the only constant is Tzeentch's inconstancy. Everywhere, though, he is a subtle manipulator with an all-encompassing knowledge. Tzeentch knows each trivial seed of hate in man's heart, just as he knows the ultimate fate of every star in the cosmos.\\n\\nHis plans are inevitably convoluted and vast, spanning across untold aeons, inexplicable and contradictory to all mortal minds. He is the puppet master, pulling the strings of fate and controlling the destiny of his followers and enemies alike. He does not manipulate the lives of men towards a specific end, at least not for long; for Tzeentch, the very act of manipulation is an end unto itself.\\n\\nTzeentch does not have a single form, often manifesting himself as a cloud of magical light that constantly changes colour. When he does take shape, his skin crawls with changing faces that leer and mock the onlooker. As he speaks, these faces repeat what he says with subtle but important differences. His head sits puckered and frowning in his chest, and his horns seem to spring from his shoulders rather than his brow. The firmament around Tzeentch is heavy with brooding magic that winds like liquid smoke around him, forming bewildering and interweaving patterns.\\n\\nTo look upon him is to offer up one’s sanity – mortal minds are not meant to glimpse infinity, and Tzeentch sits at the nexus of all possible futures.\\n\\nAs well as lord of flux, Tzeentch is also master of the ever-mutating energy that is known to mortals as magic. Known as the Great Sorcerer, Tzeentch gifts those who honour him with superior magical powers that they use to bend reality to their will.\\n\\nThe slighted, the desperate and the sly pray to him, asking for predominance over their rivals and the favour of fate itself. Ultimately it is they who will receive the gift of mutation far beyond others, for Tzeentch is synonymous with change, and true disciples of the Great Schemer accept the changes wrought upon their frames with ecstatic abandon.	false

It is he who unleashes famines and pestilence upon the world, and so it is to Nurgle that mortals turn when they wish protection from the ravages of disease and the inevitable decline brought by the passing years.\\n\\nSooner or later every mortal feels Nurgle’s debilitating touch. When the crops are spoilt, when a child falls feverish, and when wounds begin to fester on the field of battle, supplications are offered to Nurgle for him to stay his hand. These supplications are often successful, but Nurgle’s favour is bought at a terrible cost.\\n\\nKnown also as the Urfather, Onogal, Neiglen and many other titles, Nurgle is an ancient and well-established god. He has claim to the title Lord of All Things, for no matter how solid and permanent something seems, it is always liable to physical corruption. The palace of today is tomorrow’s ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation stone of everlasting regret.\\n\\nA darker counterpart to primitive deities of fertility and nature, Nurgle is portrayed as a kindly, almost jovial god, known as Father or Grandfather Nurgle to his blighted acolytes. Though he is the Lord of Decay, whose body is wracked with disease, he is full of exuberant energy and a desire to enlighten – Nurgle cherishes all life, be it mewling babe or bubonic pox.\\n\\nWhile non-believers may moan in anguish when crippling plague sweeps the lands, those dedicated to Nurgle laugh and dance to see the great works of their master unfold. They have accepted the futility of defying Nurgle and the inescapable dilapidation that he brings, embracing the fruitful delights of decay, disease and ruin. For what use is it to rail against the onset of entropy, as implacable as the passage of time itself?\\n\\nTo his followers, Nurgle appears as a gigantic and massively bloated creature, festering with boils, poxes and suppurating sores. He is surrounded by a dark cloud of tiny daemonic insects, each of which carries the symbol of the Plaguelord upon its back. Nurgle’s skin is rent and torn, and indescribable organs, rank with decay, spill through the ruptured skin and hang like drapes about his girth. From his exposed guts spill the Nurglings, the spiteful mites of Nurgle, giggling and cackling as they play amidst the filth.\\n\\nFather Nurgle has a generous spirit. He is never mean or thrifty when bestowing his latest concoctions upon the mortal realms, for within his putrescent cauldron Nurgle has gifts enough for all. The Plaguelord is said to delight in every new pox, every unique rash and blister, and of all the gods he takes the most interest in the plight of his mortal followers.	false

Known under a multitude of names, including Shornaal and Lanshor, the Lord of Pleasure is the patron of excess in all things. Master of luxury and creative power, his realms of influence include music, art and passion, but also sadism, perversion and cruelty. He is the embodiment of indulgence in all its forms, and can be found wherever discipline bows to temptation and virtue falls to vice.\\n\\nDivinely beautiful and alluring, Slaanesh exudes a palpable and irresistible charm that can leave a mortal smitten for eternity. Slaanesh most frequently appears as a radiant and slender colossus, male on the left side and female on the right, with a subtly disturbing voice that can bind a man as a spider binds a fly. He teases the souls of his enemies from their bodies as they gaze with adoration and longing into his lustrous eyes.\\n\\nThe tribesmen of the north seek the favour of Slaanesh not purely for pleasure but also for personal gain, for the Dark Prince of Chaos has it within his power to instil his followers with a portion of his radiant glory. The truly devoted of Slaanesh has legions of acolytes prepared to die on his behalf and his pick of adoring womenfolk to bear his seed.\\n\\nSlaanesh is also honoured throughout the Old World, where his principles of indulgence in every whim and vice enjoy a clandestine following. Slaanesh’s allure is highly addictive, and those who follow him are quickly overcome by the lure of pride, arrogance and excess.\\n\\nNo-one is safe from the Dark Prince, for he is not some raw elemental force that can be avoided or met with blade and shield, but the embodiment of the hidden lusts and desires that nestle in every being’s soul. Slaanesh hungrily preys upon these mortal weaknesses, watching greedily as his playthings fall from grace.\\n\\nHow many have inadvertently slipped into his tender embrace as they succumb to the sins of self-indulgence? How many leaders of men have turned to the Dark Prince of Chaos to secure their position, or to gain the support and respect of their fellows?	false

Known as Kharnath, Khorghar, Akhar and a hundred other names, the Blood God is worshipped in almost every northern tribe. Khorne is always perceived as an angry, roaring being of infinite strength and supreme battle prowess who rewards bravery, might at arms and conquest.\\n\\nThe gore-maddened followers of Khorne hunt and kill even beyond the borders of the mortal world, delighting in slaughter whether under the baking sun or by the light of a bloodstained moon. Khorne hungrily watches the carnage wrought in his name, and his bellows of bloodlust can be heard echoing across the void between worlds.\\n\\nKhorne is depicted as an overly-muscled, dog-headed giant in baroque plate mail who sits brooding upon a vast and ornately carved brass throne. The throne, in its turn, sits atop a great mountain of blood-stained bones. These are the skulls of not only his faithful champions but also those that they have slain in his name.\\n\\nTheir number is beyond counting, for every minute of every day yet more decapitations are offered unto this most violent of gods. Khorne’s Flesh Hounds gnaw upon each new offering, ever ready to hunt those cravens who will not fight in open battle. There can never be enough skulls laid at the foot of Khome’s throne, for though they feed his glory, they can never quench his eternal thirst for blood.\\n\\nBut it is not just the fierce men of the north who worship the Blood God. Many civilisations worship aspects of Khorne under a different name; even the Elven god of murder, Khaine, is thought by some to be an aspect of Khorne. There are no temples to Khorne, though, and conflict is his only ceremony, for the God of War is only truly worshipped on the battlefield. The indiscriminate bloodletting practiced by his followers is accompanied by little ritual other than their chilling battle cry – “Blood for the Blood God!”	false

Khorne despises spellcasting in general, though magical weapons that aid the business of slaughter are much favoured by his warriors. There are no wizards devoted to Khorne, for his champions epitomise those who live and die by the blade.\\n\\nA common mark worn by his followers is the Collar of Khorne, a massive, studded ring with long spikes on both the inside and out. It is said that these collars protect the wearers from hostile magic, and that Khorne’s own Flesh Hounds wear similar artefacts.\\n\\nChampions of Khorne are often unpredictable fighters, for a day that passes without adding to the slaughter in Khorne’s name is a day wasted. Furthermore, Khorne looks well upon those who sacrifice their friends or allies in the name of Khorne, and will punish a worshipper who fails in his duty as executioner.\\n\\nAfter all, Khorne cares not from whence the blood flows. For this reason, those high in the favour of Khorne are feared and hated even by other Chaos worshippers. Khorne’s champions are highly competitive, and unless they believe that their god has brought them together for a grander battle to come, when two champions meet, it inevitably ends in bloodshed and murder.\\n\\nThe armies that march to war in the name of Khorne are a terrifying sight. Of all the devotees of the Ruinous Powers, it is the minions of Khorne who prize martial prowess and iron determination most of all. The elite warriors of Khorne march tirelessly, menace in their every step.\\n\\nTheir brass-bound banners drip with gore, decorated with disembodied heads and slicked with arterial blood. They keep a grim silence as they march, each busy with waking dreams of carnage. Around them, the air seems to crackle with tension, for the longer each warrior keeps his blade sheathed, the more violent the outburst when he releases his rage.\\n\\nWhen the armies of Khorne reach the field and battle lines are drawn, the warriors of Khorne transform into a roaring, charging mass of steel and sinew that slams into the enemy line like the fist of the Blood God himself.	false

gen_lore_chs_devotees_of_slaanesh_description	Champions of Slaanesh are majestic, charismatic leaders who are adored by their followers and attract ever more armies to their side. As the Champion becomes more self-absorbed, he begins to lose that which once made him human. The favoured one becomes more distant from his followers, his otherworldy persona only furthering the devotion of his acolytes.\\n\\nSlaaneshi Champions are immensely proud of the gifts given to them by the Dark Prince, bathing in the praise heaped upon them by lesser men. They are imposing individuals, with an allure that goes beyond mere physical beauty, and they fight with effortless grace and exquisite precision.\\n\\nThe sheer presence of a Champion of Slaanesh is inspiring; they are surrounded by an aura that delights others and drives them to acts of great loyalty and sacrifice. Pain, fear, honour and loyalty become merely abstract concerns to be examined as a priest of Morr might examine a corpse.\\n\\nAs the devoted of Slaanesh slide ever deeper into the depths of depravity, a little more of their humanity drips away with every unnatural act, until they are reborn as beautiful but cruel tyrants entirely focused on their own ambitions. All other creatures become subservient to the will of the Champion, there merely to give adulation or be destroyed.\\n\\nThe glittering warhosts of Slaanesh are marvellous to behold. Long, elegant banners proclaim the glory of the Lord of the Warhost and pledge undying devotion to the Dark Prince. Each warrior is tattooed and pierced with obscene sigils and runes that hurt the naked eye, and fine silks and carefully flayed skins are draped across polished and bladed armour.\\n\\nThe Champions of Slaanesh stalk and glide across the battlefield with a languid and unhurried grace, long tongues flickering as they taste the tang of fear in the air. For although the minions of the Dark Prince indulge themselves in every vice known to the worlds of mankind and beyond, perhaps the favourite excess is to be found on the field of battle, where the devoted can bathe in the hot blood of their victims and rejoice in the screams of the dying.	false

While their bodies may corrupt and split open, the spirit of Nurgle sustains them.\\n\\nThus the Champions of Nurgle can endure wounds and afflictions that would cripple others and still fight on in his name. They are horrific to look upon, more so even than other Champions of Chaos, for their peeling flesh, stomachs bloated with corpse-gas and charnel stench are a reminder of the eventual fate that awaits all creatures.\\n\\nThe armies that march to war in Nurgle’s name are repulsive indeed. Clouds of fat-bodied flies surround the favoured of Nurgle, bathing in exposed sores and pustules and clustering into the eyes, nostrils and ears of any who look upon them. A miasma of pestilence hangs around the warriors of Nurgle like a grey-green cloud, all but suffocating any who come within range of their rusted and pock-marked blades.\\n\\nBut not all is grimness and squalor amongst the footsoldiers of Nurgle, for the favoured openly rejoice in their deity’s approval. So it is that the hosts of the Plaguelord stride to battle with the exuberance of a carnival, their armour painted in the grisly palette of sickness, phlegm-choked laughter echoing across the battlefield as they bring their deadly gifts ever closer to the foe.	false

gen_lore_chs_disciples_of_tzeentch_description	Tzeentch has many sigils and symbols, though the most common is a representation of the writhing fire of change. His Daemons and Champions are frequently gifted with eerie bird-like beaks, claws and multi-coloured feathers. Their skin and armour is in constant flow, changing shape and texture, forming grotesque cackling faces and kaleidoscopes of blazing colour that confuse and disorient those who look upon them.\\n\\nThose few who succeed upon the twisting path of Tzeentch become the most otherworldly of all Chaos Champions. They are blessed with both exceptional warrior skills and the arcane powers of the Lord of Magic. This deadly combination makes them cunning leaders and lethal warriors who command their armies with uncanny prescience.\\n\\nThe legions of Tzeentch are not as numerous as those of wrathful Khorne, and do not possess the unholy resilience of those belonging to his rival Nurgle. Nonetheless, the might of warhosts pledged to the Changer of the Ways cannot be measured with mere numbers.\\n\\nThe skies above a Tzeentchian host writhe and blaze with untrammelled power. Their banners are wreathed in bolts of sentient lightning that crackle and scream outward into the eyes of those that look upon them. The blades and armour of the chosen of Tzeentch glow with balefire.\\n\\nWhen the Great Schemer is in the ascendant, his warriors are gifted with a preternatural ability to perceive and react to a dozen different futures. Warshrines draw yet more arcane power into the ranks of the faithful as the Sorcerers at their head unleash crippling curses and bolts of magical fire that immolate or mutate everything they touch.\\n\\nThe appearance of a host of Tzeentch often heralds some drastic change in the ebb and flow of battle – an all-conquering hero finds himself reduced to a village idiot, a safe haven is transformed into a deathtrap, or a courageous last stand is turned into a rout. Such are the spectacles that amuse and occupy the Great Schemer. If the changes that entertain him can be wrought in flesh and blood then so much the better, for the transformation from life to death is the most profound of all.	false

For whatever reasons, there are times when supplies of slaves in the Dark Lands become scarce, and the Chaos Dwarfs must roam further afield, scouring faraway lands for vulnerable communities to enslave.\\n\\nChaos Dwarf ships are huge, black monstrosities, gilt in gold runes and sigils of their bull god, Hashut. They are constructed deep within the caverns of Zharr-Naggrund from mysterious ores that are smelted and beaten into huge plates of black, gold, red and bronze metal.\\n\\nThey are immense floating war engines, capable of devastating destruction. Their battlebarges are slow and ponderous vessels, but boast massive rocket batteries and siege mortars. Their more agile ships rely on battering rams and boarding actions to win the day.\\n\\nThe dull throbbing of the ships’ engines resonates across the waves as they approach, belching thick black clouds into the sky from their massive smoke stacks. When the fleet is assembled in full, it is an awe-inspiring and dread-inducing sight, and few navies of the world’s oceans can hope to stand against it.\\n	false

gen_lore_dwf_slayers_tale_description	Rorek Forkbeard glared out into the darkness, knowing that something moved out there beyond the circle of the fire's flickering light. Watchful hungry eyes measured him. A malign intelligence studied his every move. Casually Rorek finished the rest of his dried beef, then swigged the last of his ale before reaching out for his axe. He wiped his mouth on his arm, ran one huge hand through the stubble on his shaved scalp then spat into the fire. The saliva sizzled as it evaporated. Rorek stood up and made an experimental cut with his weapon.\\n\\nThe weight of the axe felt good in his hand. The runes glowed redly though whether with the reflection of the fire or the sullen glow of their own inner light, he could not tell. The grip might have been moulded for his grasp. It had belonged to his father, and his grandfather before him, and his grandfather before that. It was a potent weapon, tempered by the blood of many enemies and bright with the runes of ancient days. Tonight it would stand him in good stead.\\n\\nHe stood silent for a moment, listening to the night sounds. The fire crackled. Somewhere in the distance an owl hooted. There! He heard a sound of flesh on rock, as if something very large was trying to move stealthily and failing. Soon, Rorek thought, soon it would be over. He had come a long way to this god-forsaken place to exact vengeance for his brother and atonement for his own shame.\\n\\nRorek looked into his heart and found nothing but ashes there. He had lost all honour by letting his brother die. He was the eldest. It had been his duty to shield the lad. He had failed and the last of his blood kin was gone. The trust his father had placed in him had been ill-founded. The shame of it would have made Rorek tear out his hair, had most of it not already been shaved off. Grief and rage warred in him and he felt nothing but the urge to lash out, to rend and slay, to focus all his pent-up pain and anger against something.\\n\\nIt had been his job to lead the mule-train of ore down into the Empire of the Manlings. He should have been with the caravan that had been destroyed but a cave-in at the mine had crushed his leg and laid him up for a month. Young Algrim had gone in his place though his beard had barely an inch on it. The stupid lad had thought he could guide the caravan through these troll-haunted mountains and save the year's profits. Now his bones mingled with all the others the troll had taken. Well, no more. Tonight, it ended. Tonight the troll would die if he had to crawl down its throat and choke it.\\n\\nA shadow, huge and dark, moved in the distance. Rorek laughed aloud. The wild, bitter sound echoed through the rocks. “Come out and die,” he shouted. “Or I'll come over there and get you.”\\n\\nSlowly the thing shambled forward. It was enormous. Its yellow tusks were long as daggers and the light of blood madness glittered in the deep caves of its eyes. It flexed claws like scimitars. It let out a bellow of challenge, a weird ululating cry that would have frozen the marrow of many a bold warrior. Any sane being would have been terrified. Rorek just looked up at the towering creature. It was three times his height and twenty times his weight. He did not care. His death-song was sung. To his friends he was already dead. He considered himself a walking corpse. What use had he for fear?\\n\\nHe curled his lip into a sneer. “Your life is over,” he told the troll, then threw himself forward, axe raised to strike.	false

Some of them are renegades from the Dwarf Engineers Guild, cast from their halls for attempting to ‘improve’ tried and tested Dwarf technology. Regardless of race, most Engineers are eccentric individuals, muttering incomprehensible gobbledygook and bustling from one machine to another to improve its performance.\\n\\nThough much of an Engineer’s time is spent tinkering with half-finished inventions of whimsy, each recognises that the ultimate purpose of their labours is coming up with new ideas to combat the multifarious threats to the Empire. Anti-flyer weapons, tunnelling machines, ice rays, alchemical bombs and all manner of weird devices are but a handful of the deadly inventions devised by the Engineers.\\n	false

Tradition demands that the duel is not fought to the death, though on more than one occasion, the magical feedback has left little behind of the loser to be buried.\\n\\nMore worrisome, but fortunately much rarer, are those occasions when the magical wards about the duel fail and a roiling cloud of magic escapes, wreaking havoc as it courses through the streets of Altdorf.\\n	false

When one considers the sceptical nature of Dwarfs, it is a miracle that any common ground can be found at all, but in Sigmar they found an ally worthy of their respect and trust.\\n\\nOver and over again, Sigmar proved that Dwarfen faith was not misplaced; raising the siege of Zhufbar, fighting beside Bori Knarlhelm in the Blood-Axe Deeps, holding Black Fire Pass and many more.\\n\\nDwarfs have long memories, and they have not forgotten Sigmar’s deeds, nor the pledge of friendship they made with the barbarian king. Thus, while the Dwarfs must occasionally put the Men of the Empire in their place, they will always march in defence of the old alliance – for in a world infested by savage enemies, true friends are hard to find.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_order_silver_hammer_description	During the Time of the Three Emperors, the Empire languished in decline. Daemonologists, Necromancers, and cults were growing with startling frequency, and the Empire, such as it was, proved powerless to stop the spread. With weak and ineffectual leaders squabbling for the throne, the people turned to the Cult of Sigmar for assistance.\\n\\nTo meet the needs of the beleaguered provinces, Grand Theogonist Siebold II formed the Order of the Silver Hammer: a group of Warrior-Priests and investigators, they were committed to ferreting out the agents of Chaos. Armed with a letter of commission with the seal of the Grand Theogonist, they could reach anyone, anywhere.\\n\\nFor the next sixty years, these Witch Hunters were not regarded as a significant threat, but they slowly expanded, building a network of spies and informants. Their reputation grew, and people began to fear their power. In response to the reckless destruction wrought by Daemonologists and Necromancers, the Grand Theogonist authorised the Templars, as they were called, to use force in curbing the practice of all magic, ushering in a new era of brutal suppression of Wizards in all of their forms.\\n\\nWith power comes corruption. The Witch Hunters expanded their thin ranks by accepting nearly anyone of religious dedication to join. And so, in the years that followed, they recruited uncontrollable zealots and men of low character to aid in the fight against Chaos. And then the Grand Theogonist dispatched the Templars to cleanse the sinful city of Mordheim.\\n\\nBelieving the Sisters of Sigmar – the only order of Priestesses to serve Sigmar in any official capacity at that time – to be corrupted by the evil in the city, the Grand Theogonist branded these women heretics and excommunicated them from the cult. War raged for a year before a twin-tailed comet dropped from the heavens and wiped the City of the Damned from the map.\\n\\nOver the next three centuries, the Witch Hunters carried on as before, but the spread of Chaos proved too great a threat for them to contain. So terrible was the hold of the Ruinous Powers that in 2111, the Grand Duke of Middenheim, who was also a Witch Hunter, had the entire town of Rotebach hanged, branding them all worshippers of Chaos.\\n\\nThis event outraged the other cults, and those of Ulric, Myrmidia, and others founded their own organisations to protect their congregations, though these never amounted to anything more than a few bands of poorly funded zealots.\\n\\nIn 2301, the world changed with the coming of Asavar Kul, sparking the Great War Against Chaos. Once Magnus the Pious and his armies repulsed the horde, he was faced with reuniting an Empire that had largely disintegrated over the previous centuries.  He acknowledged the legitimacy of the Order of the Silver Hammer and bound it to the throne, thus making the Witch Hunters the official state-sanctioned and funded inquisitors of the Empire.\\n\\nThis granted the Witch Hunters considerable power, placing them above their rivals in other cults. Though they have incredible authority, they are now bound by the law and must work within its boundaries. Witch Hunters are no longer free to burn at will. Now, they may arrest any Imperial citizen they suspect to be guilty of consorting with Chaos.\\n\\nThey also have the right to interrogate the suspect, using torture if needed. And if they can gain a confession, they are within their rights to burn the suspect at once. Otherwise, they must try the accused in front of a jury of their peers. But since there are no laws governing evidence, the Witch Hunter is free to use any technique he wishes to convince the jury of the suspect’s guilt. In almost all cases, the Witch Hunter wins.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_land_of_faith_description	The Empire is a polytheistic society, a realm where it is considered only right and proper to honour all the gods. Even those priests who dedicate their lives to the worship of a particular deity show respect to other gods. That isn’t to say that the holy men of a particular priesthood don’t resent the influence of a neighbouring temple in whose shadow they lie, but to offer insult to any of the gods is tantamount to insanity.\\n\\nThe Temples of Ulric, for example, almost always have at least one shrine dedicated to Shallya, the goddess of healing and mercy, whose blessings can restore a warrior’s wounds, and a shrine to Morr, the brooding god of death who will tend to those soldiers who cannot be saved.\\n\\nHowever, of all the gods, it is Sigmar who is accepted as the patron of the Empire. This is true throughout the Empire – even in places such as Middenland, where Ulric, the warrior god of wolves and winter, is favoured, and in Talabecland, where his brother, Taal, the noble lord of nature, is more actively worshipped.\\n	false

As such, the priesthood of Sigmar has a long-founded and enduring bond with the state and Imperial family, something many worshippers deplore as an unwelcome imposition upon their personal god.\\n\\nAs a result, many sects have grown up that worship Sigmar in their own way and, of all the gods, Sigmar inspires by far the most theosophical discussion and variation of belief and practice. In addition to the principal Holy Temple of Sigmar, there are a great many splinter groups and several branches of Sigmarite theology.\\n\\nAs dark times engulf the Empire once again, these differences of theology have given rise to a score of bizarre beliefs, birthing cults of mendicants, raving stylites, isolationist hermits, violent iconoclasts and wandering bands of apocalyptic flagellants.

In addition to ruling a province, honouring certain tithes and maintaining a standing army to protect the Empire, the Elector Counts are responsible for electing one of their own number as the new Emperor should the incumbent ruler die; hence the name.\\n\\nFollowing Sigmar’s passing, there were only twelve Elector Counts. Later on, other powerful individuals won, or else bought, the right to cast their vote. These officials are known simply as ‘electors’ and, though they can vote for a candidate, they cannot themselves become Emperor.\\n\\nThere are currently five of these electors: the High Priest of the Cult of Ulric, the Elder of the Moot, and three from the Cult of Sigmar. The Sigmarite representatives are disproportionately influential, because they always cast their votes for the same candidate.\\n\\nHistorically, their votes tend to favour the Count of the Reikland, while the Cult of Ulric’s vote invariably goes to the Count of Middenheim, if he is contesting the election. The Elder of the Moot is less predictable, being more interested in the timing of his next meal than political intrigues.\\n	false

He set the great Runesmith Alaric the Mad to work making twelve rune swords, one for each of the great chieftains of men who commanded Sigmar’s armies.\\n\\nEach blade was forged from a solid nugget of the magic metal Gromril, worked under the light of the full moon, fired by the breath of the dragon Snarkul the Red, and cooled in daemon blood. With incredible patience and skill, runes were carved upon them, secret Dwarf signs whose shape and carving traps magic and binds its power into their works.\\n\\nIt took many long years for the twelve swords to emerge from the workshops of Alaric, long years even for a Dwarf, and, as it proved, more than the lifetime of a man. By the time Alaric finally finished the twelfth Runefang, Sigmar had long since passed eastward to whatever fate became him, and the original chieftains who had fought at Black Fire Pass were long dead. The Runefangs were presented to the ruling Emperor who divided them between the Elector Counts.\\n\\nSince that distant time, the Runefangs have served the counts of the Empire, having passed from ruler to ruler until the present day. As there are now only ten counts, as opposed to the original twelve, the two spare Runefangs, the Drakwald and Solland swords, are held by the Emperor as part of the Imperial armoury.\\n\\nThey are kept securely locked away in the treasure house of the Emperor, but are sometimes brought out and used in times of extreme need by mighty heroes or powerful wizards. The Solland Sword was lost for many years, having disappeared during the destruction of Solland by Gorbad Ironclaw’s Orcs.

Since the Emperor is chosen from amongst the Elector Counts, the capital is wherever the current Emperor has court. As such, the Empire’s capital has changed many times over the centuries.\\n\\nWith the election of Mandred Ratslayer following the Skaven wars, the Imperial court moved from Altdorf to Middenheim. After Mandred’s death, numerous claimants vied for superiority and there were several ‘capitals’ in the anarchy of the Time of Three Emperors. The ascension of Magnus the Pious, the so-called Griffon Emperor, ended this division and the Imperial court came to Nuln.\\n\\nWith the election of the Reikland Princes following the Marienburg scandal, the Imperial court once again took up residence in Altdorf. Many people (not least the Prince of Altdorf) view Altdorf as the first city of the Empire anyway, since it is built on the site of the Unberogen settlement of Reikdorf, the birthplace of Sigmar.\\n	false

Belmont may fight like a Griffon. as they said, but he looked more like an armoured peacock.\\n\\nKriegersen hefted his ancient warhammer meaningfully. “There will be time for this after the killing,” he muttered, his words lost under the clarion calls sounding the advance. Turning to his knights, Kriegersen raised his hammer to the skies. “This day, we bring death to our enemies once more!

gen_lore_emp_history_rise_of_sigmar_description	The human tribes had never marched beneath one banner, but when the Dwarfs of the mountains found common cause with Men against the hordes of Greenskins, they were able to broker allegiances and truces that brought thousands of fierce, well-armed warriors eastwards.\\n\\nThe mightiest of these men was known as Sigmar, the first son of the Unberogen chieftain, whose auspicious birth had been heralded by a twin-tailed comet blazing across the sky. Sigmar was a respected warrior of great nobility, courage and strength, and legend says that by his fifteenth year he had already led the terrifying Unberogens into battle against the Orc hordes dozens of times.\\n\\nAs the decades of bloodshed and warfare dragged on, the Orcs and Goblins grew more cunning and, in one daring attack, captured Kurgan Ironbeard – High King of the Dwarfs – as he made his way to the Grey Mountains, as well as several members of his royal household.\\n\\nAs fate would have it, Sigmar and his most trusted warriors were already hunting this band of Orcs and caught them in the deep forest before they could escape. Sigmar slew many Orcs that day, burning their foul corpses on a huge pyre after freeing the Dwarf captives.\\n\\nIn gratitude for his release, King Kurgan presented Sigmar with a magical heirloom of his family – a magnificent rune-forged warhammer named Ghal Maraz, which means “Skull Splitter” in the ancient Dwarf tongue.\\n\\nSigmar accepted the king’s generous gift and the two warriors pledged to aid one another in the wars against the rampaging Greenskins, and so the bond between Men and Dwarfs became ever stronger as the threat from the east grew.\\n\\nSigmar wielded Ghal Maraz in battle after bloody battle like a thunderbolt of destruction, wading into living seas of Greenskins and smiting all about him with prodigious fury, earning the nickname “Heldenhammer” – the Hammer of Goblins.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_founder_of_a_nation_description	Upon the death of his father, Sigmar became chieftain of the Unberogens and set about uniting the human tribes of the west through a combination of conquest and cooperation. Sigmar was a powerful and charismatic leader, but above all, he had a vision: a land united under his rule, free of Orcs and Goblins, governed by fair laws and protected by a strong, disciplined army.\\n\\nAfter years of bloody war and diplomacy, twelve of the great tribes of Men had sworn mighty oaths to follow Sigmar and, together with his Dwarf allies, he drove the Greenskin scourge from the lands west of the Worlds Edge Mountains.\\n\\nThe few Human tribes who still opposed Sigmar, mostly ancient enemies of the Unberogens, were driven south into the inhospitable Grey Mountains or, like the Norsii, north beyond the Middle Mountains, leaving Sigmar the undisputed ruler of the lands between the Worlds Edge Mountains and the Great Ocean.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_founding_of_the_empire_description	In recognition of his incredible victory at Black Fire Pass, the High Priest of Ulric pronounced Sigmar Emperor of all the lands between the Grey Mountains and the Middle Mountains in the north, and King Kurgan presented Sigmar with a magnificent Dwarf-forged crown.\\n\\nThe Emperor and the Dwarf High King swore oaths of eternal friendship to one another and, in gratitude for their aid in saving the Dwarf realms, Kurgan commanded the Runesmith Alaric the Mad to begin the long process of creating twelve magical swords, known as Runefangs, for each of the tribal chieftains.\\n\\nSigmar’s coronation marks the beginning of the Imperial Calendar and the first day of the Empire. He ruled justly and courageously from his capital, Reikdorf (later to be renamed Altdorf), granting land to the twelve tribal chieftains who had sworn allegiance to him and aided him in his many wars against the Greenskins.\\n\\nThese divisions were based upon the old tribal territories, but they also absorbed the lands and peoples of many smaller tribes, as well as those that had previously belonged to the enemies of the Unberogens. The chieftains of these twelve provinces each took the title of count and they were bound to Sigmar by oaths of loyalty. In return, they and their heirs were to rule in his name.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_man_myth_legend_description	Sigmar ruled the Empire for fifty years and, during this time, rough villages blossomed into small towns, the people multiplied, and many new settlements were founded. Of course, there were still enemies to fight.\\n\\nMarauding Goblins continued to cross over the Worlds Edge Mountains, and there were plenty of savage Human tribes that raided the fledgling Empire from the northern forests beyond the Middle Mountains. Little else is known of Sigmar’s reign, for the Dwarf annals thereafter are concerned chiefly with their own affairs.\\n\\nAll that is known for certain is that Sigmar eventually put aside his crown and journeyed eastwards, supposedly to Karaz-a-Karak to meet his old friend Kurgan Ironbeard. If he ever arrived, the records do not tell, but he was never seen by his people again.\\n\\nThe time of Sigmar passed, and he became a legend, the heroic forebear of his people. Temples and shrines were built to his memory, and a cult grew up to venerate him as the Empire’s founder. Within a generation, Sigmar was openly worshipped as a god, with his own priesthood headed by a Grand Theogonist, Johann Helsturm, who became a powerful religious leader.\\n\\nThe Cult of Sigmar became one of the most powerful faiths in the land with many thousands of loyal followers, and the hero of Black Fire Pass took his place alongside the pantheon of the old gods of the Empire.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_the_age_of_anarchy_description	From its earliest days, the Empire was a loosely organised confederacy of tribal leaders, bound by common bonds of friendship and a mutual loyalty to the Emperor. With Sigmar’s passing, it was feared that destructive wars would erupt between the counts he left behind, but instead of fighting to sec who should rule, the counts gathered at the capital of Reikdorf to decide what should be done.\\n\\nAfter much tense deliberation, the counts swore that they would hold true to Sigmar’s vision. They agreed that one of their number should be chosen to take up the mantle of Emperor, and that the Emperor should hold his title only with the majority consent of the counts themselves.\\n\\nThe counts became known thereafter as Elector Counts and the system of elected Emperors was established. This was to continue in one form or another to the present day, even surviving long periods where powerful Emperors manipulated the elective body to further their own interests and times when civil wars erupted amongst rival states.\\n\\nThe Empire grew in power during those early times, but it is also clear that there was little respite from anarchy and war. Rampaging Orc and Goblin warbands swept down from the mountains relentlessly, and in their wake, the battlefields would be stained red with the blood of men.\\n\\nBeastmen rampaged through the dark forests, destroying whole settlements and glutting on the flesh of the slaughtered. Skaven, a race of loathsome ratmen, erupted from beneath the sewers of ever-growing cities to drown the surface dwellers in a tide of mangy fur and rusty blades, and shambling corpses rose from their graves to wreak destruction upon the living.\\n\\nThese and other horrors assailed the Empire every year, but under the leadership of the Elector Counts, the armies of the Empire fought their enemies with courage and ingenuity, and the land remained more or less united.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_the_skaven_wars_description	In the centuries following Sigmar’s passing, no Emperor was as hated as Boris Goldgather. During his grossly incompetent rule, the Empire struggled under the burden of excessive taxation and corrupt officials. People starved, state armies were neglected, and border forts were left virtually unmanned.\\n\\nIn this weakened, dispirited condition, the Empire was in no state to weather the Black Plague of 1111. Many thousands died over that winter; entire towns and villages were wiped out as the virulent disease spread with unnatural rapidity. By the time the plague subsided, three quarters of the Empire’s population were rotting in open, mass graves.\\n\\nThe only good thing to come of the plague was that it claimed the life of Emperor Goldgather, who died in his castle surrounded by fretting apothecaries (none of whom, it is believed, tried too hard to save him), and news of his death helped to raise morale amongst the oppressed populace.\\n\\nWithout an Emperor, even one as incompetent as Boris Goldgather, the Empire was at its most vulnerable. To make matters worse, hordes of Skaven scurried out of their hidden underground tunnels beneath the Empire’s cities, preying wherever the Black Plague – which they had themselves unleashed upon the Old World – had done its work.\\n\\nThousands of citizens were slaughtered or enslaved, but those who remained fought back bravely under the inspired leadership of Count Mandred of Middenheim – later known as the Skavenslayer. Mandred rallied the surviving Elector Counts and led an army of his countrymen against the malevolent ratmen, fighting a series of bloody battles that culminated at the Battle of the Howling Hills.\\n\\nThere, Mandred beheaded the verminous Warlord at the head of the Skaven army with one stroke of his Runefang. Following the battle, Count Mandred had the Warlord’s skull fashioned into a helmet of terrifying aspect that would forever live in the darkest nightmares of the ratmen.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_the_empire_divided_description	The Empire recovered from the Skaven wars, largely thanks to the dynamic leadership of the newly elected Emperor Mandred. His generalship and charismatic personality held the Empire together, but with its population ravaged, many villages were simply abandoned and whole regions became wastelands.\\n\\nTragically, Mandred’s life – and with it the Empire’s recovery – was ended upon the envenomed blade of a Skaven assassin, and in the years following this calamity, the electoral system of the Empire began to fall apart.\\n\\nPersonal rivalries, conflicting ambitions and petty jealousy divided the Elector Counts and they failed to reach a decision as to who should become the new Emperor. Blood was shed when these squabbles turned violent, and the counts returned to their lands with anger in their hearts.\\n\\nIn 1360, Ottilia, the Elector Countess of Talabecland, proclaimed herself Empress and declared war upon her main rival, the Elector Count of Stirland. In the years that followed, the Imperial crown passed between the Elector Counts as the Empire broke apart into separate warring states.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_time_three_emperors_description	The next few centuries following Emperor Mandred’s passing saw a succession of Emperors, as one pretender after another launched a bloody coup to claim to the throne. The Empire was riven by internecine fighting that soon turned to openly declared civil war. There was even an era when there were two Emperors at the same time – one was the elected Emperor and the other was the Elector Count of Talabecland, who continued to claim a hereditary position as Emperor following the self-appointed reign of Empress Ottilia.\\n\\nIn effect, Talabecland had seceded from the Empire, and was joined at various times by other provinces that were dissatisfied with the current elected Emperor. To make matters worse, in 1547, Count Siegfried of Middenland decided to declare himself Emperor as well. This audacious proclamation marked the beginning of the time of Three Emperors, with each claimant soliciting allies and supporters amongst the others.\\n\\nThe provinces of the Empire had now become more or less ungovernable, and for the next century and a half, the Elector Counts fought rivals and rebellions within their own lands as well as the numerous enemies and monstrous foes that assailed them from without.\\n\\nAs the power of the Elector Counts continued to decline, the Empire’s cities looked more to their own affairs, and those that were not destroyed by war became prosperous under the leadership of Burgomeisters – leaders elected from the mercantile classes and other wealthy citizens.\\n\\nMany of the larger cities began to construct fortifications and recruit their own standing armies – in effect becoming independent military, economic and political states from their surrounding provinces. With Sigmar’s people divided into squabbling fiefdoms, the Empire was easy prey and its enemies gathered at the borders like carrion eaters around a corpse. The most brutal of these enemies would see the Empire lose an entire province to war and destruction.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_destruction_of_solland_subtitle	The Destruction of Solland	false
gen_lore_emp_history_destruction_of_solland_description	The Empire was brought to its knees by Gorbad Ironclaw, the most feared Orc Warboss of the age. Around the year 1705, he arose to command a vast horde of Orcs and Goblins, which he led through Black Fire Pass to devastate the provinces of Averland and Solland.\\n\\nCount Eldred of Solland marched his forces north to the River Aver, where he commanded the crossing beyond Averheim. Gorbad’s army plunged into the river and attacked the defenders on the opposite bank. Though the Greenskin horde lost thousands of warriors crossing the river, cut down by merciless volleys of bow fire, the Orcs relentlessly advanced and they eventually succeeded in gaining a foothold on the opposite riverbank.\\n\\nThis was a grim turn for the defenders, for their only hope had been to hold the Orcs on the far side. The Solland army found itself becoming encircled and Eldred desperately sought to quit the field of battle before his men were slaughtered. But Eldred’s decision came too late, for Gorbad had earlier despatched his cavalry to attack the Halfling realm of the Moot further east, and they now circled around to head off the retreating Empire army.\\n\\nAs Eldred’s personal bodyguard battled to protect their lord, Goblin Wolf Riders and Orcs on vicious boars rode over the horizon to flank the Empire army. Within moments, a disciplined withdrawal had turned into a rout and, knowing that the day was lost, Eldred led Greatswords into the swirling melee in a final gamble to slay the Orc leader. Resplendent in his long silver cloak and glittering crown, the last Elector Count of Solland faced the terrifying form of Gorbad Ironclaw in single combat.\\n\\nGorbad was monstrously huge and, even armed with a mighty Runefang, Eldred was no match for him. The Elector Count’s body was brutally hacked down, dismembered and hung upon Gorbad’s trophy racks. The Orc Warlord captured Eldred’s Runefang and crown as spoils of war, and the few survivors knew the battle thereafter as the Battle of Solland’s Crown.\\n\\nGorbad’s invasion was ultimately defeated at the Siege of Altdorf, a titanic battle in which the elected Emperor, Sigismund IV, was slain whilst defending his realm. The threat to the Empire from Gorbad Ironclaw was ended, though the province of Solland was utterly destroyed.\\n\\nThe devastated lands have since been entirely subsumed by Wissenland, and though there are some proud nobles who refuse to acknowledge the rights of the Wissenland count, referring to the region as Sudenland instead, its status as an independent province ceased from that day.\\n\\nIt was long feared that the Solland Runefang was lost forever but, centuries later, a warrior band led by the Dwarf Thane, Ergrim Stonehammer, recovered the magical blade deep in the lair of a mutated beast beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. The adventurers returned to the Empire and presented the Runefang to the Prince of Altdorf, an act that was greeted with great celebration. However, as Solland no longer existed, and hence there was no Elector Count to wield the sword, it was kept in the Imperial Treasury – to be entrusted to the greatest of heroes in times of dire need.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_first_vampire_war_description	As the Time of Three Emperors dragged on, a dreadful threat was stirring in the most infamous region of the Empire – Sylvania, a benighted region on the eastern border of Stirland shunned by all right-thinking people. Through a combination of deception, sorcery and bloody murder, a vampire named Vlad von Carstein had wrested control of the region from its previous ruler, Otto von Drak.\\n\\nMany noble families objected to the thought of having an outsider rule them, but these dissidents were quickly silenced. Under Vlad’s iron grip, Sylvania grew strong, and the taint of vampirism spread. So, for over two hundred years, Vlad ruled over Sylvania under the guise of different identities to prevent anyone from becoming aware of his undying nature.\\n\\nThe Elector Counts looked on with indifference at these changes, too caught up in their own petty power struggles to care about such a backward corner of the Empire. In 2010, judging the Empire to be at its weakest, Vlad launched his bid to become the immortal Vampire Emperor.\\n\\nMarching at the head of a host of Undead, Vlad laid waste to the other regions of Stirland and invaded Ostermark before turning his attention to the heart of the Empire. For forty years, Vlad’s armies of skeletons, ghouls and walking corpses ravaged the land until he eventually fought his way to Altdorf, seat of Prince Ludwig, one of the claimants to the title of Emperor.\\n\\nThe siege lasted many months, but in the Empire’s darkest hour, the Grand Theogonist, Wilhelm III, seized Vlad in a desperate grip and bore him from the city walls, impaling them both on the stakes at the base of the wall. With Vlad gone, his Vampire lieutenants retreated and much of the Undead army began to disintegrate.\\n\\nPrince Ludwig marshalled his forces to give pursuit, but fearful that the victory would give his bid for the throne more credence, his rivals united against him, and the Vampires of Sylvania were given time to regroup and regain their strength.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_second_vampire_war_description	Years after Vlad von Carstein’s demise beneath the battlements of Altdorf, Konrad von Carstein emerged as his successor and launched another invasion of the Empire. So great was his insane viciousness that the three claimants to the Imperial throne put aside their differences and combined forces against him on two separate occasions.\\n\\nThe first time was at the Battle of Four Armies, an inconclusive clash fought outside Middenheim in 2100. This battle was most notable for the infamous scene of treachery where Ludwig’s son and successor, Lutwik, and Ottilia IV of Talabecland treacherously ordered the assassination of each other during the fray – after all, a battlefield is the ideal place for a blade in the back. In the chaos that followed their mutual destruction, the nobles of the Empire desperately sought to unite under a single leader. Helmut of Marienburg was the prime candidate.\\n\\nA conclave of the Elector Counts assembled at Averheim to decide the matter. Even as support for him was gathering in the council hall, Helmut began to act erratically, struck dumb and vacant at a critical time. Helmut’s skin began to peel away and one of his eyes dropped out, much to the horror of the assembled counts.\\n\\nEven Helmut’s son, Helmar, refused his father’s claim to the throne once it was discovered that Helmut was a Zombie under Konrad’s control! Discovered, Konrad’s Necromancers fled with their Zombie Emperor-to-be. Enraged that his devious plan had failed, Konrad slaughtered his way from Averheim to the Howling Hills, putting to the torch every town and village he came across.\\n\\nGrim Moor marked the second alliance to face Konrad von Carstein. Here, in the spring of 2121, a combined army of men and Dwarfs finally met Konrad’s host. Konrad was so incensed he ordered his army to attack the combined forces arrayed against him, rather than retreat further.\\n\\nThe armoured warriors of Konrad’s elite withstood the punishment dealt them by the handguns and war machines of the Empire and Dwarf gun lines, striding relentlessly forward. But then, the regiments of the Undead faltered; the magic that bound them seeped away and they collapsed. Konrad’s Necromancers had betrayed him and fled. It was only Konrad’s raw will and innate Vampire abilities that kept any semblance of his army animated, but the effort proved too much.\\n\\nIn a mad fit, Konrad wandered away from the battle, shouting maniacally. The Dwarf hero Grufbad captured Konrad and held him down while the Elector Count Helmar impaled his father’s killer with his Runefang.\\n	false

He allowed the various contenders for the Imperial throne to think that the Undead threat was truly over, waiting for them to fall upon one another again. When the Empire was once more wracked by civil war, Mannfred attacked.\\n\\nHis skeletal legions marched unhindered upon Altdorf and defeated the hastily assembled armies sent to stop him. However, Mannfred was forced to retreat when the new Grand Theogonist, Kurt III, appeared on the battlements and began to recite the Great Spell of Unbinding from the Liber Mortis – a powerful enchantment that caused many of the Vampire’s Undead followers to crumble into dust.\\n\\nAfter an abortive attack on Marienburg, the Vampire Lord was driven back to Sylvania, where the Imperial nobles put aside their differences and joined forces to end the threat of the Vampires once and for all. Eventually, Mannfred was brought to battle at Hel Fenn in the year 2145 where Prince Martin, the Elector Count of Stirland, cut him down in single combat.\\n\\nFor his heroic feat, Prince Martin claimed all of Sylvania and thus were ended the Vampire Wars, though the threat of the Vampire Counts’ return ensures that none dare forget the dread of this shadow-haunted land. Though ostensibly part of Stirland, Sylvania is, in reality, an abandoned region where the dead do not rest easy, and the dark forests are haunted by all manner of revenants and unspeakable horrors.\\n	false

gen_lore_emp_history_great_war_against_chaos_description	As bloody as the Age of Anarchy had been, the Empire’s greatest test was yet to come. The Realm of Chaos is a place polluted with evil sorcery. It is a nightmarish landscape from which hordes of bloodthirsty marauders, iron-clad champions, mutant monsters and vile Daemons launch their attacks upon the world.\\n\\nThis war-wracked land lies far to the north of the Empire. However, when the Winds of Magic blow strongly the Realm of Chaos expands; the Northern Wastes are swallowed up and the armies of Chaos pour down through Troll Country into Kislev and the Empire. The furthest the Realm of Chaos has ever expanded in the history of the Empire was during the Great War Against Chaos, which began in the year 2301.\\n\\nHaving risen to prominence among the northern barbarian tribes over many years, Asavar Kul was the most powerful champion of the Dark Gods to have ascended in an age. With his nightmarish armies finally united, he moved southwards, fuelled by the growing tide of Chaos.\\n\\nDaemons moved with them, sustained by fresh tides of life-giving magic, and herds of Beastmen rampaged unchecked through the forests. In the heartlands of the Empire, evil sorcerers and worshippers of the Chaos Gods emerged from their secret conclaves to attack human society from within.\\n\\nAs winter engulfed the Old World, the Chaos armies struck. The northern lands of Kislev were quickly overwhelmed. An army of Kislevites and Ostlanders mustered to face Kul and his unholy allies, but it was crushed north of the city of Praag. Nothing, it seemed, could stop Kul’s murderous advance, and despite a fierce battle at the bridges of the River Lynsk, the Empire and Kislevite forces were massacred, and Kul’s forces crossed the last barrier between it and Praag.\\n\\nThe Siege of Praag lasted until late 2302, with the city’s brave defenders hurling back their attackers time and again with desperate heroics and stalwart bravery. As winter set in once more and the year drew to a close, Praag finally fell, and the hordes of Chaos ran amok within its walls.\\n\\nThe raw power of Chaos engulfed the city and Praag was changed forever, its survivors fused together in hellish and inhuman shapes. Living bodies melted into the walls of the city itself so that it became impossible to tell flesh from stone. Distorted faces peered from walls, agonised limbs writhed from the pavements, and pillars of stone groaned with voices that issued from once human lips. Praag had become a living nightmare and a grim warning of the suffering that lay ahead for all if the warriors of the Dark Gods were victorious.\\n	false

A leader arose from the horror of these troubled times: Magnus, a noble of Nuln. He would later become known as Magnus the Pious because of his unflinching devotion to the Cult of Sigmar and to the ideals of nationhood that Sigmar still signified in the divided Empire.\\n\\nMagnus was a magnificent orator whose rousing speeches raised a massive following among the common folk of the Empire. He marched northwards from city to city, addressing the people in the marketplaces, gathering about him an army the likes of which had not been seen for centuries.\\n\\nThe Elector Counts and Burgomeisters were shrewd politicians and recognised Magnus as a powerful leader, quickly realising that they could gain much prestige and political power by supporting him. Soon, the soldiers of the Elector Counts and the noble warriors of the Empire’s Knightly Orders marched alongside Magnus’ citizen militia, and by the time the army reached Middenheim, it was the single largest force that had ever been assembled in the history of the Empire.\\n	false

Concentrating on the trapped defenders, the Chaos army was ill prepared for this fresh assault, and they were scattered by the sudden attack.\\n\\nGrim-faced regiments of state troops drove a wedge deep within the Chaos host, supported by hails of crossbow bolts and thunderous volleys of handgun fire. Artillerymen from Nuln, amongst the very first warriors to flock to Magnus’ griffon-emblazoned banner, deployed in commanding positions overlooking the battlefield and then wreaked a terrible toll on the Chaos forces.\\n\\nThe battle went well for Magnus initially and victory seemed assured, but Asavar Kul was a mighty leader and rallied his warriors to counter-attack. Before long, the greater numbers of the Chaos force began to tell, and Magnus’ army was gradually pushed back into a defensive circle.\\n\\nHorrifying daemons slaughtered entire regiments with razor talons and brazen, spell-forged blades, while evil sorcerers unleashed powerful, ancient magic. Teclis, and a handful of human wizards he had recently trained, fought against the sorcery of Kul’s shamans in magical battles that burned the skies.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs inside Kislev attempted to break out to help Magnus, but they were contained and forced back behind the city’s walls.

As Kul’s warriors fell upon their foes, Magnus’ second army, consisting of Kislevite lancers and Imperial knights returning from Praag, appeared over the ridge of what would become known as the Hill of Heroes, and they thundered into their enemies with hatred burning in their hearts.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs and remaining defenders charged once more from the city and Magnus seized this last, desperate chance to lead the Men of the Empire forwards in glorious battle. The Chaos hordes faltered, as they suddenly faced no less than three armies, and began to stampede in every direction, bewildered and confused by this new turn of events.\\n\\nThe Kislevites were driven to wild fury by the destruction they had witnessed in Praag, and the host of Asavar Kul was slaughtered by the implacable anger of the combined forces. The magic of Teclis and his human apprentices immolated entire regiments of mindless Chaos Spawns and dozens of blood-crazed Chimerae, while frenzied Manticores were struck from the skies by sorcerous thunderbolts.\\n\\nThe army of Chaos was shattered and thousands of its warriors were hacked down as they turned to flee in utter rout. As the witches and sorcerers of the Chaos host were cut down, the foul magic binding the Daemons to the mortal realm was severed and the unholy creatures exploded into mists of blood and clouds of flies.\\n\\nThe Old World had been saved, and the Realm of Chaos shrank away to the north once more.\\n	false

The Elector Counts could not have voted otherwise even if they had wanted; the people demanded it and were not to be denied. Magnus the Pious proved an extremely able Emperor and immediately set about restoring order to the provinces of the Empire. The servants of Chaos were hunted down in the forests, and many wild and long-abandoned lands were resettled.\\n\\nMagnus knew that if the Empire was to survive, it needed the aid of its allies, and thus one of his first acts was to ask Teclis to create an institution whereby wizards might be properly trained. Though many Elves claimed that the secrets of sorcery were not meant for Men, Teclis realised that the safety of the world rested upon the folk of the Empire, and so he agreed to Magnus’ request. Thus were the Colleges of Magic established in Altdorf.\\n\\nMagnus also recognised the valuable contributions the master gunners of Nuln and the Engineers of Altdorf had made to the defence of the Empire. He granted them formal charter and, forever more, both institutions would proudly bear the prefix ‘Imperial’, becoming integral parts of the Emperor’s armies in the war-wracked years to come.\\n\\nWhen Magnus died, the Imperial crown passed to Count Leopold of Stirland, and subsequently to his grandson, Dieter. It was during the reign of Dieter that the city of Marienburg ceded from the Empire in return for a huge donation to the Imperial coffers.\\n\\nDieter did not prove a popular leader – many thought that he had accepted the Marienburger’s money a little too readily – and he was replaced by Wilhelm III, Prince of Altdorf and Elector Count of Reikland.

However, there is only one obscure reference to this meeting, thought unreliable by many.\\n\\nAlso, the appearance of the Carstein Ring, as described by those who fought Vlad, was more contemporary in design. If indeed Nagash ever made such a ring, it is more likely that the Carstein Ring is a less powerful copy. Vlad demonstrated no particular skills of artisanship, so it is certain that the Carstein Ring was not made by him. It is more likely that Vlad forced a thrall Necromancer to create it or took it from its owner.\\n\\nSome believe that Mannfred spent much of his time away from Sylvania seeking Felix Mann to recover the ring. If he was successful, he never revealed this to anyone else.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_carnival_of_chaos_description	A daemonic carnival is said to roam the mortal world on ill-fated nights. Creaking wheels and the clop of hooves at dusk announces its arrival. From the gloom emerges a procession of wagons drawn by emaciated horses.\\n\\nThe once colourful canvasses of these decrepit carts are torn aside, and gangrenous daemons jump out. Plaguebearers prepare for the performance while Nurglings bicker underfoot. From the largest carriage shuffles a hulking Great Unclean One, the plagued ringleader of the show.\\n\\nThe daemons begin their Dance of Death around the chosen settlement. Nurglings sing in falsetto, the Plaguebearers in tenor, and the Great Unclean One provides a deep baritone. They sing of the delicious doom that awaits their victims.\\n\\nAs the pageant progresses, the cacophony gets louder, and is joined by the howls of dogs and lowing of cattle from the nearby settlement. Pandemonium seeps into the dreams of the sleeping villagers, while those awake lie paralysed with fear.\\n\\nUpon the seventh circuit, the hullabaloo rises to fever pitch. Butter curdles, and milk sours. As a pale sun dawns in a sallow sky, silence falls. Then the daemons begin the main entertainment, afflicting every known disease upon their screaming audience. By nightfall, only rotten bones tell of the carnival’s passing.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_the_blood_kiss_description	The life of a Vampire begins in blood. Despite common myth, simply being bitten or drained by a Vampire is not sufficient to turn anyone into a child of blood. The transformation only comes from a shared ritual where both parties drink deeply of each other. Known variously as the Blood Kiss, the Dark Awakening, Turning and the Red Ascension, the experience is as terrifying as it is exhilarating.\\n\\nThe hot, hunting blood of the Vampire flows into the veins, burning out the weak, mortal blood as it goes. What happens to the life and soul of the Human during this transformation is unknown, and every Vampire that speaks of it has described something different.\\n\\nSome mortal priests suggest that they enter the Garden of Morr but are turned back because they are an abomination to His sight. Scholars and wizards sometimes talk of them moving between the realms, trapped forever between this world and the next.\\n\\nWhatever the truth, every Vampire awakens with a newly forged spirit. They retain the thoughts and memories of the mortal they once were, but within them now is a dark beast, driving them to hunt and prey, to revel in their every twisted vice, and to glory in all their dark desires.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_the_tireless_hordes_description	Relentless, implacable and dreadful, the Undead are among the most dangerous opponents in the known world. Bound by the will of their Vampire, they are a fell and mighty force. They cannot be reasoned with, bribed or coerced. They know neither fear nor mercy. They need neither sleep nor warmth, drink nor wholesome sustenance. As they spread across the land, their ranks swell with the corpses, and sometimes even the spirits, of their slain foes.\\n\\nFew things inspire more fear in the hearts of men than the sight of the walking dead. Their cadaverous forms are wrapped in funerary vestments, and they wield ancient, rusty weapons - they are a vision of the fate that awaits all living creatures.\\n\\nWhen confronted by that which haunts all Men’s nightmares, most mortals feel an indescribable horror, as much a weapon as any blade, and only the bravest warriors will stand their ground. When the Undead march to war, all the living tremble in fear.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_places_of_death_description	To understand the restless dead, one must understand the nature of magic. The Winds of Magic constantly emerge from the Realm of Chaos and blow out across the world. Magical energies permeate everything. Gusting down from the Chaos Wastes, most of the currents of magical energy separate into one of the eight colours of magic. Some, however, remain a roiling mass of pure Dark Magic that descends where it will.\\n\\nA peculiar quality of Dark Magic is that like attracts like. Once Dark Magic starts to build up in an area, more and more of it will be drawn to that same place. This forms a swirling vortex of evil that eventually coalesces into a solid form - warpstone. It is Dark Magic that provides the power to animate the dead, therefore, many of the areas where that fell force waxes strongest are also the places that attract or spawn Undead.\\n\\nSome philosophers observe that, since Chaos feeds on strong emotions, places where great negative emotions such as fear, terror, hatred and horror have been felt also attract Dark Magic. They claim that battlefields, plague-stricken towns and houses where dark deeds of murder have been committed draw the forces of undeath to them.\\n\\nAlternatively, it could simply be a reflection of the fact that dreadful energies are often unleashed during battles, or that the mass graves and plague pits of diseased townships attract and provide cover for Vampires and their unspeakable rites.\\n\\nWhatever the reason, there are particular areas in the Old World and beyond that attract the Undead. These areas include the Desolation of Nagash, the Land of the Dead, the Imperial realm of Sylvania, the cursed city of Mousillon in Bretonnia, the Barrow Hills in the Border Princes, the Ghoul Caves in the Worlds Edge Mountains, the Zombie-haunted swamps south of Skavenblight in Tilea, and the Mound of Krell in the Grey Mountains.\\n\\nThese areas, ill-famed as they may be, are far from being the only places where the Undead are found. Any lonely tower with access to old burial grounds or crypts may be the haunt of a Necromancer or, worse still, one of the Vampires that they usually serve.\\n	false

Since the defeat of the von Carsteins, most Vampires remain hidden from the eyes of Man. However, Vampires occasionally inveigle themselves into the great cities of the Empire, moving in high society where their lordly positions allow them to conceal their true natures.\\n\\nSome lurk in the deep woodlands or within dark caverns, preying on travellers and peasants. A few dwell within the mist-shrouded ruins of their old castles and emerge from their cobwebbed crypts to feast intermittently on whatever they can find. Others still have become debased and feral creatures, feeding on fresh corpses in graveyards and making their lairs in dusty mausoleums.\\n\\nSuch is the Vampires' innate dominion over death that it is impossible to ever know for certain whether they have been slain. They have a habit of returning and wreaking terrible vengeance on their would-be slayers when least expected.\\n\\nA Vampire can lie dormant for years, decades or even centuries, gathering his might while his minions prepare the way for his return to power. When a powerful Vampire stirs, the Dark Magic he exudes acts as a magical beacon to spirits and dead things for many miles around. In this manner, a Vampire draws all manner of dreadful creatures to his service. Once at his full strength, the Vampire will muster his horde of the Undead and go forth once more, fighting in pursuit of his depraved ambitions.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_lands_of_sylvania_description	From the Spider Haunts to the Bane of Troth, Corpse Run to the Necromanse, Sylvania is a realm steeped in dark legend. Under the shadow of the Vampires, its populace has become a terrified, superstitious people.\\n\\nClose to uninhabitable, Sylvania's forests are dingy copses of twisted, half-rotted trees that claw what nourishment they can from the bone-strewn soil. Desolate moorlands and sluggish rivers of clotted blood punctuate the yellow-leafed woods, wind-swept and storm-shrouded by dark clouds that seep down from the Worlds Edge Mountains on an almost daily basis.\\n\\nIt is a depressing, dismal realm settled in the time of Sigmar by dissident, evil men dispossessed by the god-king's unification of the peoples of the Empire. When warpstone shards fell upon the lands in 1111 , Sylvania's fell reputation was sealed, as the dead erupted from their graves and laid siege to the villages and towns. Ever since, it has been a loathed and feared province, avoided by the other people of the Empire, common folk and lawmakers alike.\\n\\nSparsely populated, Sylvania has long proved a refuge for men intent on dark deeds and secretive studies, as well as evil creatures hunted by the forces of the Emperor. Long before Vlad von Carstein unleashed his Undead armies upon the Empire, Sylvania had been home to Crypt Ghouls, Necromancers and Chaos worshippers. Sylvania is nominally part of Stirland now, though Vlad's bloody legacy holds Sylvania in its infernal grip; the dread realm is still home to brooding malice and evil powers.\\n\\nIn crumbling castles, towering mausoleums and forgotten keeps dwell the Vampire progeny of Vlad von Carstein. Though they are wary now of the Empire, united as it is under the rule of Emperor Karl Franz, the surviving von Carsteins still plot and scheme, dreaming of immortal power. They muster their forces in secret, building armies of the dead from bodies and bones, waiting for any sign of weakness in the Empire.\\n	false

Grubbing what existence they can from the infertile land, the peasantry live in small communities of inter-related families, and never venture far from their crude hovels.\\n\\nThere are few stone roads here; rutted, half-flooded tracks and paths link most villages, all but impossible to navigate except in the relatively dry summer months. At times, the mud itself seems to be a living thing, clawing at the legs of the weak and dragging them to a suffocating death.\\n\\nThe populace are for the most part concerned with day-to-day survival, raising famished, skinny goats and pigs, tending to what scraps of farmland they have in the hope of gathering enough crops to survive the long and cruel winter. \\n\\nSylvanian villages are in a constant state of disrepair, for good stone and wood is hard to come by. All, however, have barred or boarded windows and heavy doors to keep out the night’s predators. Crude fetishes and charms of a dozen gods hang on every lintel and frame.\\n\\nThe villagers daub symbols of protection on their doors with pig's blood, to guard against the unnatural horrors of this frightful land. Hanging outside the gates of the most desperate townships can be found criminals and travellers caged in iron maidens, their only companions the crows and vampire bats that feed on them.\\n\\nEver since Vlad closed the holy shrines, they have fallen into decrepitude, for no priest ventures into Sylvania without a sturdy guard of armed men. Truly, Sylvania is a godless realm, for darkness claimed it many centuries ago.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_geheimnisnacht_hexensnacht_description	There are two nights every year considered evil above all others, when the dark spirits of the world come forth and the creatures of Chaos howl in the darkness. The first night is Hexensnacht, the Witching Night, which marks the new year. The better known, and more feared night, is Geheimnisnacht, the Night of Mysteries.\\n\\nThese are the only two nights when both moons, Morrslieb and Mannslieb, are completely full. Where Mannslieb is bright and consistent, Morrslieb is an unpredictable and immense chunk of warpstone, a massive satellite of raw magic. Whenever Morrslieb nears the surface of the world, the Winds of Magic blow fiercely and Dark Magic gathers in invisible tides and pools.\\n\\nIt is this Dark Magic that stirs the dead in their graves, mutates unborn animals and drives livestock to devour each other. The combined forces of both moons pulling at the world at the same time make these nights extremely important to cultists, Necromancers, Vampires and other fell sorcerers, for at such times their powers are at their height.\\n\\nSacrifices are made to the dark gods, and dire rituals bring forth whole armies from their graves. Ancient artefacts are bound into reliquaries and unholy weapons are forged. The people of the Old World bar their doors and windows, mutter prayers, stoke their fires high, and pray that they will survive to see the dawn.\\n	false

The sluggish, bitter blood that spilled from the creature’s mouth did not interest Pieter in the slightest. The moment of death was far more intoxicating. Pieter felt the strength in his dead muscles swelling.\\n\\nA crude, cleaver-like blade thudded into Pieter’s arm, clanging off his lacquered armour. Contemptuously, Pieter lashed out with his claws, tearing off the Orc’s face in one swipe. As another blow skidded ineffectually from Pieter’s helm, the Vampire looked at the tattered web of skin that drooped from his fingers, and casually flicked it away.\\n\\nA spear tip plunged into Pieter’s cheek, and he broke from his bloodthirsty reverie to focus on the Greenskins swarming around him. With a snarl, the Vampire slashed his sword across the chest of an Orc, knocking it backwards into its bellowing fellows. A reverse sweep decapitated another Greenskin, and Pieter’s armour was drenched in an arterial fountain.\\n\\nDriven on by the love of death, Pieter hacked and chopped, his Grave Guard unceremoniously beheading any Orcs that escaped his wrath. Suddenly, Pieter realised that his foes had scattered and fled. Ahead, the Orcs were rallying after the rout, and were gathering inside the log walls of their primitive compound.\\n\\n“Attend me,” Pieter snarled, gesturing to an imposing figure that stood nearby, clad in tarnished gold and bronze armour, a glowing sword in its skeletal grip. Asteron, long-dead monarch of the Dolgars, approached Pieter, eyes blazing.\\n\\n[[i]]What is your will, master?[[/i]]\\n\\nThe Wight’s thoughts entered Pieter’s head without sound, resonating like the echoes of a crypt.\\n\\n“Assemble your warriors, prepare for the final attack,” Pieter commanded.\\n\\n[[i]]As you will it, master, so shall it be.[[/i]]\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_vanhals_legacy_description	In 1111, the dead first walked in the Empire. Corpses marked with the black blotches of plague shambled about the land, needing only a will to guide them. They found it in the form of Baron Frederick van Hal (later known as Vanhal or Vanhel). After conquering the land that eventually became Sylvania, he built his keep at Vanhaldenschlosse.\\n\\nDuring the time of the Black Death, the Empire suffered at the hands of the Skaven, and only the expansion of Vanhal’s necromantic domain halted the ratmen’s advance. The Skaven and the Undead fought a long and futile war that only ended when Vanhal was assassinated by his apprentice, Lothar von Diehl.\\n\\nThe Skaven, however, were left in a weakened state, allowing the future emperor, Mandred Skavenslayer, to drive them from the land. Later generations of the Vanhal line took up the oath of the Witch Hunter in an attempt to atone for the sins of their heretical ancestor.\\n	false

Many of these tomb settlements were unaffected by Nagash’s great awakening and lie as tumbled ruins, but some were touched by the dark magic and their occupants arose from their slumbers just as in the south.\\n\\nThese are the Barrow Kings, as jealous of the living as the Tomb Kings of Khemri, and as warlike and ambitious in death as they were in life.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_the_black_art_description	Dark magic is a destructive, corrupting force. To channel its energies, Necromancers must use corpses to shield themselves from its effects. Without this protection, a Necromancer will slowly wither away until he becomes a wraith. A Vampire can unleash the full power of Dark Magic without risk of harming itself, and so has an intrinsic control over the Undead that a human Necromancer can never achieve.\\n\\nOnly a few Vampires go on to learn new spells; the majority use their Necromancer minions to attend to the day-to-day rituals of summoning and binding. Many of a Necromancer’s duties are less glorious and arcane than they first imagined. They are mainly responsible for digging up corpses, fixing broken Zombies and skeletons with wood, metal and nails so that they can be re-animated.

These are the Vampires of the Strigoi; bestial descendants of the Vampires that once ruled the city of Strigos in the Badlands. When their undying king, Ushoran, was slain and the city razed by Greenskins, the Strigoi spread out across the world to seek refuge with other Vampires.\\n\\nUshoran had been an arrogant lord and other Vampires remembered this. The Strigoi were cast out or hunted down by their ‘civilised’ kin, and over time the Strigoi devolved into filthy, brutish monsters. They remember something of their golden age as lords of an eternal kingdom. Their long lives are fuelled by a bitter hatred of the living creatures and other Vampires that brought about their fall from power.\\n\\nThe Strigany families who roam the Old World are itinerant pedlars in garish caravans who are descended from the mortal inhabitants of Strigos. Their ancient association with the forces of darkness means the Strigany have an ill reputation in the Empire and beyond. The Strigany are widely believed to still be in league with their Vampire masters, leading to hatred and persecution wherever they travel.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_origins_description	In hieroglyphs and reliefs one can see how the aristocracy of Nehekhara once hunted men at night and drained their blood. The oldest and most obscure scrolls mention the cursed name, Nagash. His story is told elsewhere, but here it is sufficient to say that this evil Necromancer found an alchemical substance that granted immortality.\\n\\nThis hideous liquid was called the Elixir of Life, but the price was terrible. After many long years, the Great Necromancer became more and more cadaverous and corpse-like, until his evil was evident to all.\\n\\nOther kings of Nehekhara gathered their armies and sent them against the Great Necromancer. Nagash was defeated in this ancient war and forced to flee from the Land of the Dead, but the secret of the Elixir of Life was stolen by the nobles of Lahmia, one of the great cities of Nehekhara. They took it back to their city, and started experimenting with it.\\n\\nTheir lifespans grew ever longer. but after centuries its use caused strange changes in the Lahmian nobles. Their teeth changed into great fangs, their skins became as white as alabaster and their eves glowed red in the darkness. Those who drank the elixir could no longer be nourished by food or drink, but began to prey upon living men and drank their warm blood.\\n\\nSunshine burned them, so they had to live in darkness and rest during the day. And worst of all, they could pass this curse on to others. By allowing a mortal to drink their blood, the taint would pass on to the victim. These were the first true Vampires.\\n\\nThe Vampires had eternal life and great powers, but it seems that this curse was eventually their downfall. The hieroglyphs tell how their fellow men turned against the blood-drinkers. Once more there was war in Nehekhara. The rulers of the other cities, alarmed by the tidings from Lahmia, mustered their armies.\\n\\nThe Lahmian vampires fought against the grand alliance of Nehekhara led by King Alcadizaar, but in the end they were defeated and forced to flee. Most of them were killed in the bitter siege of Lahmia, or hunted down by the victorious armies of Khemri and Numas and slain in their tombs. during the hours of daylight.\\n\\nBut the eroded scrolls of Lahmia describe how seven great Vampire lords and their closest followers escaped the sacking of the City of the Vampires. Chief amongst them were Ushoran, the Lord of Masks, Ahhorash of the Blood, Vashanesh, the king of Lahmia, and Neferata, Queen of Shadows.\\n\\nThe remaining Vampires held council. Their defeat was a bitter blow to the arrogant immortals. They had tasted power and found it to their liking, but now they had lost everything. In the end, they decided to part company and conquer domains of their own. Once they became powerful enough, they would return and reclaim their thrones. So the Vampires went their separate ways. Four of them went north to the kingdoms of men in the Old World, and have haunted the dark places there ever since.\\n\\nOf the remaining Vampires, little is known. Perhaps they went to other corners of the known world, or perished in ancient battles. If any still exist, they are ancient indeed, and surely powerful beyond mortal comprehension.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_the_beast_within_description	A Vampire has to keep his tainted blood and raging dark energy checked. Often, this becomes too much, and an angry Vampire can kill a man in a fit of rage. An enraged Vampire is terrible to behold – he transforms from his mortal likeness into a fiend with razor-sharp fangs, long talons and bestial features. His eyes gleam with unnatural light and the mere glance of a Vampire can cause the bravest mortal warrior to flee in panic.\\n\\nAfter a time, a Vampire becomes so soaked in blood that he no longer cares about the death of a mortal. He may still have his human appearance, but no pity, compassion or mercy lives in his cold, unbeating heart. Vampiric blood flows through his veins and he is so unnatural that he casts no reflection on mirrored surfaces. He is now truly of the Undead.\\n\\nTo a Vampire, human society is a blur of chance, for they do not age or change as men do. Such a life puts a terrible pressure on the minds of these beings and madness is their constant companion. If one considers the differences between these immortals and mere humans, it is easy to see why Vampires feel no pity or kinship with men. Their terrible hunger forces them into acts of murder and violence and their physical and mental superiority is vast. It is little wonder that Vampires view all of humanity as mere cattle.\\n\\nMany Vampires grow weary of their eternal existence, but they fear their final death more than the horror of living forever in undeath. It is said that their evil deeds condemn them to eternal torture in the realm of the dead and thus they cling to their bodily lives, hating their unlife but fearing the final judgment which will be passed on them in the afterlife.\\n	false

The older Vampires can also choose to grant the Blood Kiss to more than one victim, while most of the younger Vampires can grant only a single Blood Kiss during their long and lonely existence.\\n\\nThough immortal, they have weaknesses that their enemies can exploit. Sunlight renders them almost powerless and will eventually destroy them. A stake driven through the heart will end their unnatural life, and their absent reflections in mirrors can betray their mortal guises.\\n\\nHoly men have power over them, though this does not always hold true in every scenario. They cannot cross running water except over a bridge. They can conjure a multitude of mindless Undead slaves to serve them, but will only have a few intelligent allies.\\n\\nThey must feast on human blood or wither away into nothing, and because of this, Vampires are always few in number. Large groups of these unnatural lords would require huge numbers of mortals to feed upon and would quickly attract the attention of the rulers of the kingdoms of the Old World.

He tasted the cool night, savoured the wind in his hair, the smell of the horse’s flank, the tantalising tang of battle to come.

A true and pure creature of battle, with a blood of steel and a soul – if he had ever had such a thing once, he knew he did now – of martial fire.\\n\\nHe was a sword made flesh, a master of combat, a storm of destruction and defeat.

gen_lore_vmp_the_unternehmung_description	When Captain Schluter of the good ship Unternehmung took on two of the River Strigany as crew, he paid no heed to the ridiculous rumours of superstitious sailors. The Strigany proved to be hard working and knew their way around a boat as if they were born to it. All this nonsense about being in league with the powers of darkness was clearly rot.\\n\\nThen the food spoiled. Every last morsel on board went bad, weeks out from land. His crew’s bellies started grumbling, and so did they. Mutiny was inevitable, and the Strigany, having proven sound fellows, were its ringleaders.\\n\\nThe first order of business was to round up the captain and those crewmembers still loyal to him and lock them in the brig. The second order of business was to haul them back out of the brig and cook them up to replace the spoiled supplies.\\n\\nThe Unternehmung sailed for weeks with no sight of land, and more and more of the prisoners were eaten. But each time another scapegoat was chosen to go in the pot, the crew only seemed to get hungrier. The hunger was like a living thing, gnawing at their bellies and whispering dark thoughts into their brains.\\n\\nWhen Nanosh of the Strigoi finally climbed out of his coffin of grave dirt stowed in the hold and showed himself, his servants had done their work. Every surviving member of the Unternehmung’s crew was a ravening Ghoul, ready to serve their new captain eagerly if it meant fresh meat.\\n\\nNow, Nanosh and the Unternehmung crew sail through seas of blood, launching night-time raids on ships and coastal towns, dragging screaming meat back onto their ship for future meals. Even the pirates of Sartosa fear the Unternehmung and her Ghoulish crew.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_curse_of_undeath_description	The Tomb Kings reign from their necropolises as they have always done, imitating the life they once knew. Many Tomb Kings behave as if nothing were awry, ruling as if they were still beings of flesh and blood. Perhaps some are truly unaware that they are Undead, whilst others are in denial of their cursed existence or have been driven mad by the sight of their own hideous visage.\\n\\nA Tomb King may demand a bowel of sweet figs and a goblet of fine wine, seemingly oblivious that the contents of such a meal would spill through their desiccated bodies onto the floor. When the proffered meal arrives, a Tomb King will simply stare at the fruit, wondering what such a thing is for, until it either rots to dust or a vestigial memory surfaces, allowing a moment of clarity to reassert itself.\\n\\nIn that instant, the Tomb King recalls all the pride, majesty and greatness of what he was and the cruel parody of what he has become. Realising that he will never know the taste of food, the quenching relief of cool water, the sensation of touch or any other simple joy ever again, the Tomb King will enter a fit of incandescent rage.\\n\\nAncient and wrathful, all that is left for the Tomb Kings is their hunger for power, their thirst for conquest and their need for vengeance. The Tomb Kings are unremitting in their eternal war upon those who have the temerity to live whilst their rightful rulers languish in undeath.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_the_time_before_man_description	According to the myths and legends of Nehekhara, in the times before men, gods walked the world as mortals. It was believed by the ancient Nehekharans that when the Desert Gods first arrived in the Great Land, they fought the armies of vile Daemons and foul spirits that lurked there in great battles that lasted for many centuries.\\n\\nIn numerous inscriptions, carved on the tombs and monuments of ancient cities, it is written that Ptra, the Sun God and King of the Nehekharan pantheon, led the final battle against the dark powers. Riding a resplendent golden chariot, he drove the darkness back; even the most powerful Daemon recoiled from the touch of his divine light. Ptra and the Desert Gods were victorious, and the evil ones retreated north to escape destruction.\\n\\nLegend says that the Desert Gods then transformed the lands into a verdant realm and ruled there for thousands of years until the birth of the race of Man. It is said that these people were so favoured by the heavens that Ptra himself bestowed upon them the fertile land that would later be called Nehekhara.\\n\\nIn exchange for their worship, the deities offered to protect and watch over those that dwelt in the Great Land. With the covenant made, the gods nurtured the people of the nomadic tribes, teaching them how to read, write and build great cities. Thus was the Nehekharan civilisation born.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_the_realm_of_souls_description	The Realm of Souls is the revered afterlife of the ancient Nehekharans. It was believed that upon death, the deceased’s spirit would enter the Realm of Souls – also known as the Underworld or the Netherworld. Here the Kings of Nehekhara would reside in fantastic palaces until such time as a golden paradise worthy of their status was prepared, whereupon they would rule for a million years. It would be filled with all their servants, soldiers and worldly possessions, and so these were necessarily buried beside their monarch upon his death.\\n\\nHowever, not all inhabitants in the Realm of Souls would be afforded such luxury, for in the lowest levels, the cursed and the damned would be subject to an eternity of torture for their sins. Only the wretches, the unworthy and the traitors of Nehekharan society were condemned thus, and the idea that those of noble blood could be damned to such a fate was unthinkable.\\n\\nThe Liche Priests of the Mortuary Cult believe that their magical powers originate from the Realm of Souls. With the proper incantations, the Liche Priests are able to summon forth the spirits of deceased warriors from this mystical plain and bind them into corporeal bodies to fight for Nehekhara once more.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_legions_of_legend_description	Throughout the dynasties of Nehekhara, there have been many courageous legions whose names and deeds are inscribed on the walls of the necropolises beside those of their ancient kings. Many were easily recognised for their distinct appearance.\\n\\nThe noble-born warriors of Rasetra’s Crocodile Squadron were wealthy fighters who decorated their chariots with the hides and teeth of the exotic jungle creatures they had slain. The Khepra Guard carried ebony shields studded with bronze scarabs. The Golden Host of Mahrak, whose swords were made from precious metals, have, in death, become their namesake by walking through a pool of molten gold to gild their bones.\\n\\nThere are countless others, from the Sphinx Legion of Numas to the Zandri Blackshields, however; the most feared of all were the Hawk Legions of Settra. In unlife, these loyal soldiers remain deadly and implacable foes.

gen_lore_tmb_the_crimson_king_description	Imrathepis, the Crimson King of Numas, was an aggressive and brilliant general. His stalwart legions were easily recognised by their blood-red banners and shields, and Imrathepis himself rode to war atop a magnificent Khemrian Warsphinx whose flanks were deep scarlet.\\n\\nIn his mortal lifetime, King Imrathepis fought beside Alcadizaar the Conqueror, and he was one of the great ruler’s chief lieutenants. The Crimson King was present during many pivotal battles, including the subjugation of Ka-Sabar, the pacification of the Black Boar Orc tribes and the sacking of cursed Lahmia, where Imrathepis bested several Vampires in personal combat.\\n\\nIn undeath, King Imrathepis' thirst for battle was no longer tempered by the wisdom of Alcadizaar. Upon awakening from his sacred sarcophagus, the Crimson King immediately set about reclaiming the lands he had conquered in centuries past. Imrathepis and his legions swept north through the Badlands like a hurricane of blood.\\n\\nFrom atop the armoured platform of his Khemrian Warsphinx, the Crimson King slew scores of Greenskin savages. Imrathepis would lead every charge from the front, driving his curved, golden-edged blade deep into the flesh of his enemies as his Khemrian Warsphinx, dripping with the blood of the slaughtered, waded through the hordes of Orcs and pulped their bodies underfoot. The impetuous king then drove his Undead legions eastwards into the Mountains of Mourn, forging through the wind-swept passes in search of more foes to vanquish.\\n\\nKing Imrathepis' arrogance was to be his undoing, and he was finally defeated by the Ogres of the Thunderhoof Tribe. Imrathepis mistakenly believed the Ogres to be nothing more than simple brutes. The Crimson King was therefore completely unprepared when the Ogres ambushed the Undead by unleashing a herd of stampeding Rhinoxen within the narrow confines of Daggertooth Valley.\\n\\nThe skeletal warriors of the Crimson King’s legions were crushed to powdered bone by the great cave beasts, and only Imrathepis, standing atop his carmine Warsphinx, survived. Though his mount had been buffeted and its stone body was cracked, the great Khemrian Warsphinx did not yield. Alas, Imrathepis was now alone and surrounded by the entire Ogre tribe.\\n\\nHowling a curse, the Crimson King and his battered mount drove on regardless, smiting a score of Ogres before finally succumbing to the hammer-blows of the tribe’s Ironguts. After the battle, the Ogre’s Tyrant, Folgut the Corpulent, snapped the Tomb King’s leg off and fashioned it into a toothpick before returning to his mountain lair.\\n\\nHowever, the royal line of King Imrathepis did not end there, and Prince Rakaph III, dynastic heir to the Crimson King, set off from Numas a mere decade later to enact his father's revenge. Rakaph III led not one, but a dozen Khemrian Warsphinxes into the Mountains of Mourn to destroy the Thunderhoof Ogres.\\n\\nThe hulking leonine statues trekked to the summit of Cragg Rock, which overlooked the Ogres lair, before battering their stone limbs into the mountainside, causing a titanic avalanche that buried the entire Thunderhoof Tribe beneath several thousand tons of rock and ice.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_the_war_statuary_of_nehekhara_description	It was not just the elite soldiery of Nehekhara’s legions that achieved great status in ancient times. The names of countless war-statues are recorded on the surfaces of tombs and sarcophagi as well.\\n\\nThe Bone Giants of Bhagar were such creations, magnificent Necrolith Colossi whose bodies and limbs were carved from a white marble said to be indistinguishable from actual bone. Time and again the Bone Giants strode out to battle, and not even the bravest heroes could stand against these skull-faced giants of death.\\n\\nThe Alabaster Army of Quatar was perhaps even more feared, for their ivory ranks crushed whole armies underfoot. These towering Ushabti fought like the gods they portrayed, and they would return after a battle was won to stand once more in the alcoves of the White Palace, their flanks still slick with the blood of the slain.\\n\\nThe Emerald Sentinels of Lybaras, the Golden Warsphinx of King Anubekh, the Skull Guardian of the Charnel Valley, the list of legendary constructs goes on. However, all these statues are said to be eclipsed by the size and majesty of the Hieroscorpion of Khemri, whose titanic form, as large as a burial pyramid, was forged from jet obsidian and blood-cooled bronze. This gargantuan creation prowls the deserts to this day, preying on any who dare trespass into the Land of the Dead.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_the_nehekharan_pantheon_description	It was the Nehekharans’ belief that their gods dwelt in the Great Land in the time before the birth of Men. It is said that the span of the deities’ lives was numbered in millions of years. After this golden era when the gods walked as men, they became invisible spirits, able to take on any form that they desired. Thus it was that Asaph, goddess of beauty, magic and vengeance, chose the form of the asp, and Khsar took on the elemental form of the desert wind.\\n\\nMost depictions of the gods in this grand pantheon show them in these powerful forms, and they are commonly carved as guardian Ushabti in the tombs of kings. Some of the most common statues include Djaf, the swift to anger jackal-headed god, and Phakth, the deity of the hawk, who is said to be able to see the evil and sins of the dead.\\n\\nPtra, the Sun God, was the most widely worshipped of all the numerous divinities, symbolising eternity and immortality. In the stories recorded in numerous inscriptions, Ptra is said to ride his golden chariot across the skies, forever chasing his beloved, the moon-goddess.\\n\\nThe Gods Qu’aph, Ualatp and Sokth took the form of the cobra, vulture and scorpion, while others chose the crocodile, the ibis or particular stone formations of the desert. Some divinities took no particular form, and it is these that are the most mysterious and sinister of all. Pha’a and Usekph are two of these gods, said to dwell in spirit form within almighty tombs buried beneath the sands, and their names are used in the direst of curses and invocations.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_the_barrow_kings_description	Scattered throughout the Old World and beyond lie ancient cairns, the burial places of early kings and their most loyal warriors. They are the last remnants of an ancient people predating the coming of Sigmar. Little is known of them, for they did not record their histories in written form, relying on a tradition of storytelling.\\n\\nThese barrows are mounds of earth piled over a tomb, usually accessed by a single entrance. They range greatly in size, and some of the largest can be seen on the skyline for many miles around. Macabre and superstitious stories surround these mounds, and those who live near them go out of their way not to walk in their shadow.\\n\\nBedecked in bronze armour, rumours say that these ancient kings stride from their burial mounds in the darkness, their warriors, loyal beyond the grave, marching at their side. It is said that the ancient druids of these people, figures of particular power and authority within the society, still walk the earth, directing mysterious powers and incantations against those who would desecrate the ancient kings’ resting places.\\n\\nScattered throughout the wilder lands are towering statues, and though weatherbeaten and old, many of them still resemble the nature gods and spirits that were once worshipped. It is said that these megalithic statues arise on nights of the new and full moons to stalk the darkness at the whim of the ancient druids. Some have speculated that there appears to be some link between these peoples and the ancient Nehekharans, although scholars have thus far been unable to prove this claim.\\n	false

The lanterns of the Night Watch were all but lost in the thickening mist and the hourly tolling of the “All’s-well” sounded muffled and distant. The men of the patrolling night watch were wary. for the fog seemed sinister and wholly unnatural, but only the soft lapping of the canal waters and the damp dripping of condensed moisture could be heard.\\n\\nNone marked the furtive scuffling of clawed feet across the cobblestones. Many of the town’s patrol were already missing when some sixth sense caused Capitano Rizzilo to spin around. Behind him, outlined in the fog, were dozens of black-clad and shadowy figures. Underneath their cowls verminous eyes reflected crimson in the flickering light. The clash of steel that followed was brief, but enough to raise the alarm.\\n\\nAs the clanging warnings rang out they were, in turn, answered by a discordant clamour from the surrounding fog. Abandoning all pretence of stealth, a chittering horde rose up and advanced into Mironia. So it was that the soldiers and townsfolk awoke to find themselves under full-fledged attack.\\n\\nA wall of rune-marked shields stretched across the narrow streets.

Despite the risk, it is coveted by dark sorcerers, necromancers and alchemists. Yet none scour the lands as greedily as the Skaven, who prize the substance above all others.\\n\\nWarpstone enters the world in a number of different ways. Clouds of warpstone dust drifts through the Realm of Chaos; blowing southwards out of the Northern Wastes during the great storms of Dark Magic that precede evil times.\\n\\nIf powerful enough, Dark Magic can actually pool and crystallise into the distinctive nuggets that glow black with ominous hues of venomous green. The largest pieces of warpstone, however, plummet from the skies as meteors from the sickly second moon known as Morrslieb.\\n\\nThe role of warpstone in Skaven society is manifold, forming the power supply for their twisted technology and spellcasting, as well as the key ingredient in their mutating agents.

The great gate lay ahead, the symbol of Averland emblazoned on its surface.\\n\\n“Move it, ladz!” he bellowed.\\n\\nAhead, Wolf Riders skirmished with the fragile lines of archers, while behind them hordes of Greenskins hooted and clamoured for violence. Lumbering Giants the size of watchtowers strode alongside packs of repugnant Trolls; ovoid Squigs chomped and snapped at the remnants of Empire Outriders.\\n\\nHewing and cleaving this way and that, Nagbad drove his boyz through an armoured regiment of Greatswords.

Nagbad leapt from his boar and thumped his ensorcelled chopper into the wood. An explosion of splinters rewarded him, and he struck again.

gen_lore_grn_waaagh_description	All Greenskins want to fight alongside a powerful Warboss who has built a reputation for leading his tribe to victories. This is partly because they all want to be on the winning side, but mainly because no mob wants to miss a good scrap. The biggest Warbosses lead their tribe to so many victories and cause such commotion that lesser tribes flock from far away to join the mighty commander. Thus the living tidal wave of destruction known to the Greenskins as a Waaagh! is born.\\n\\nA small Waaagh! occurs when a few tribes unite to launch an attack, while a larger Waaagh! is an epoch-changing invasion that draws Orcs and Goblins from many thousands of miles around. A Waaagh! generates untold fervour amidst the Greenskins and sweeps violently over anything in its path, irrevocably changing the landscape and laying bare swathes of territory.\\n\\nSome Waaaghs! travel a short distance before dispersing, while others have crossed half the known world, charting a zigzag course as utterly unpredictable as the Greenskins themselves. The largest Waaaghs! are the stuff of legend – the earth shaking beneath the immense armies that gather to march forth and destroy. The devastation wrought by such invasions blots the sun behind palls of smoke, covering great portions of the world in a shroud of darkness.\\n\\nIt is unknown how many Orc & Goblin tribes exist, for they seem to crop up everywhere. Greenskins proliferate quickly, a large force gathering in a fortnight, yet even a sizable horde can disperse overnight if the tribes fall out due to quarrelling. As most Orcs and Goblins are nomadic, travelling where necessity (i.e. fighting and loot) takes them, it is hard to gauge their numbers.\\n\\nThe more civilised races of the world – Men, Elves and Dwarfs, for example – know that there are Greenskins in the wild regions, but whether they are massing for a great migratory invasion or merely drifting by in disorganised packs of unruly raiders is impossible to discern. Many of the largest invasions have come without warning, building up mass and momentum too quickly to be foreseen.\\n	false

Far above any mere fetishes or minor idols, however, are the real powerhouses of the Greenskin pantheon, the boisterous and belligerent brother-gods known as Gork and Mork.\\n\\nGreenskins do not call upon Gork and Mork for aid when they are in trouble, nor do Orcs and Goblins beseech them for gifts, such as softer or punier races might do. Instead, these war-gods and their infamous deeds serve as inspiration. Gork is brutal but kunnin' and his brother Mork is kunnin' but brutal. Every Greenskin has complete and unquestioning faith that if he is brutal or kunnin' enough, he will join the gods after his death and continue the fight.\\n\\nThe power of their gods is made visible to Greenskins in many ways. The almighty phenomenon of the Waaagh!, that almost spiritual calling to war that fills every Greenskin with frenetic energy, is the will of Gork and Mork made manifest.\\n\\nShamans, as Greenskins call their wizards, are also directly connected to the gods. A Shaman can tap into that green power to blast foes or rouse Greenskins to greater heights of violence. Clearly, however, such communication with the gods unhinges the minds of every Shaman.

Wazwhoompa, their Shaman, had just begun to use mighty green magics to reshape a vast block into a more pleasing shape when eldritch bolts arced from the stone and struck him.\\n\\nIn his death throes, Wazwhoompa spoke, saying “Da tribe must take dis idol to da Badlands.” Then, the old Shaman twitched and shuttered, gasping with his last breath... “Zak Aloooog”. At least that’s what they thought he said; there was an awful lot of twitching.\\n\\nBeing extremely superstitious, the tribe has ever since dragged the monumentally large stone with them as they make their slow journey northwards. Each night they make camp around it, and anyone who dares attack soon learns that the ominous rock is imbued with potent magics. The strange idol glows, granting the ‘Eadhuntaz and their Shaman mysterious powers...\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_hero_for_a_day_description	Despite his diminutive stature, Goblin Big Boss Snorko the Sneak is fondly remembered by Greenskins everywhere as the hero of the Blood Peak Massacre. Finding himself caught betwixt the duel of Warlord Bludgit the Beater and an Elven Prince upon a Star Dragon, Snorko did as any right-thinking Goblin would do – pulled his spiked helm over his head and cowered.\\n\\nAs the mighty Dragon inhaled, preparing to unleash a torrent of fire upon the embattled Bludgit, the terrified Snorko was sucked into the Dragon's gullet where, thanks to his spiked helm, he lodged fast. While Bludgit clobbered the Elven rider to death, the Dragon choked on the unfortunate Snorko and died shortly thereafter.\\n\\nOnly when the battle was won, and Bludgit’s Black Orcs were chopping up the Dragon for eating, was the hapless Goblin discovered. Snorko was pronounced a hero and elevated to the honorary rank of Big Boss in Chief. He did not, however, survive the celebratory beatings.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_chain_squigs_unleashed_description	The Ironbreakers formed a living wall across the passageway, their backs against the last gateway protecting the hold above. The Night Goblins had tried for days to breach this tunnel, but the Dwarfs had held firm, their nigh-impenetrable armour blocking the feeble strikes of the Greenskins, while their own axes claimed the lives of many foul Grobi. The Dwarfs were tired, but unyielding. They had fought the Night Goblins enough not to trust this lull in the fighting, suspecting some new trickery.\\n\\nSounds could be heard on the other side of the mound of Goblin corpses that blocked the tunnel and soon two immense Squig-beasts emerged over the pile. The creatures snorted with rage as they were prodded down the passageway. When the Squigs caught Dwarf-scent at the end of the hallway, no further goading was needed, and they bounded forward.\\n\\nThe beasts were chained together, and they stumbled over each other, crashing against the narrow confines. Yet for all of their commotion, the tumbling did not slow their pace, but accelerated it to breakneck speed. Each snarling fiend whipped the other around in a dizzying whirl until all that could be seen were flashes of teeth, swirling chain, or a semi pulped Night Goblin who was tied onto one of the Squigs.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs raised their shields against the living thunderbolt, but to no avail – the rotating Squigs scattered the Dwarfs like skittles and smashed straight into the gate beyond with a resounding clang. Although a few of the severed limbs still twitched, not a thing was still alive. The pathway into the Dwarfhold was opened and the Night Goblin assault began in earnest.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_waaagh_nogdrod_description	When Waaagh! Nogdrod descended upon the city of Baltheim, it found the entire Talabecland army arrayed against it. Thousands of soldiers were arrayed in Baltheim’s defence, hardy warriors of Talabecland who stood firm as the Waaagh! surged forward. So valiant were the men of the Empire that Nogdrod swiftly lost patience with his army’s progress. He spurred his wyvern, Snaptooth, forward to the centre of the enemy army, where Arch Lector Fedorin marshalled his troops from a War Altar’s lofty perch.\\n\\nAs the Wyvern’s shadow fell over him, the Arch Lector smote his staff upon the ground and a bolt of holy soulfire leapt forth, charring the creature’s scaly hide. Dull-witted though Snaptooth was, he knew pain well enough and fled into the lightning-flecked skies – carrying an unwilling Warboss with him.\\n\\nThe Greenskins, their enthusiasm for the fight subdued by their Warboss’ seeming retreat, lost all heart as the Talabeclanders surged forward. The Goblins routed first, to the usual Orcish jeers, but then the Orcs swiftly decided that, for once, the gobbos had the right of it and so began to retreat themselves. Seeing victory in his grasp, Fedorin roused the men of Talabecland to fresh deeds. He called upon Sigmar, upon duty to Emperor, land and lord. Ten thousand soldiers cheered their reply in one voice, and carried their swords and spears forward onto the Greenskins.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Fedorin, this was the precise moment at which Nogdrod, having finally regained control of his unruly steed, re-entered the battle. Bellowing wildly, Warboss and Wyvern burst through the encircling storm clouds like a mucky emerald thunderbolt and slammed into the War Altar with a deafening thud; timbers splintered, iron buckled, and the War Altar exploded in a shower of debris. In the wake of the battle, his aides were to diligently search the crater, but all they would find of their fallen master was a single finger bearing his ring of office.\\n\\nFor their part, Warboss and Wyvern had indeed survived, thanks mostly to a pair of thick skulls, and they rose roaring from the wreckage. Nogdrod’s victorious cry was answered from every corner of the battlefield, as his boyz took heart from their boss’ deeds. Where the horde had been in full retreat it now surged forward once again.\\n\\nThe Talabecland forces, who had thought the battle done and the pursuit begun, were caught completely wrong-footed. In moments, what had been a proud-arrayed army of the Empire was reduced to scattered islands of desperate warriors huddled around their regimental colours, calling on their last dregs of courage to stave off a sea of Greenskins. All to no avail.\\n	false

Grognok, Ludo deployed a grand army upon the frigid banks of the River Sol and confidently awaited the Greenskin offensive.\\n\\nThe attack came before dawn, as two score Goblin Wolf Riders splashed noisily across a deep, icy ford and overran the pickets. Howling Wolf Riders swept through the Empire camp, moonlight gleaming upon their filthy bodies. Their flesh, and that of their mounts, was smeared in a thick, greasy coating of Troll fat; ample protection from the winter chill.\\n\\nQuickly they loosed a salvo of arrows, cheerfully insulted the parentage of their foe and awaited the reaction. Duly enraged, Brecht roused his warriors, and barely gave them time to gather their weapons before ordering them to chase the whooping Goblins. As they retreated across the river, the Wolf Riders chanted one word over and over again: ‘Gitilla!’\\n\\nWhile the Troll fat protected Gitilla and his Howlerz from the icy ricer, the Empire soldiers stumbled and trembled, while weapons slipped from icy fingers. As the Empire vanguard reached the other bank, they looked into the eyes of a horde of fresh, rested Orcs, and realised their folly.\\n	false

gen_lore_def_fate_of_the_body_description	When a Dark Elf dies, his fellows seldom care for the empty shell he leaves behind. Weakness is despised in Naggaroth, and it is a rare individual whose death cannot be attributed in some way to a frailty of body or paucity of resolve. \\n\\nOf course, there are exceptions. For all the Dark Elves' callous and hard-bitten ways, bonds of genuine friendship and admiration do exist in Naggaroth (though the latter is often a wary acceptance of a rival’s ability). Such bonds are carefully concealed lest they be seen as weakness.\\n\\nThey nevertheless ensure that some individuals are thought well enough of to earn eternal repose in an obsidian sepulchre, rather than suffer a brief and bloody tenure as fodder for Harpies and Cold Ones. Even bitter rivals may be accorded this honour. Nothing reinforces a Dark Elf’s sense of superiority (and security) quite so much as knowing not only that his enemy has perished, but also where the body is buried, should he wish to view it.\\n\\nEven the Witch King is not immune to the lure of such reassurance; thus is the concourse approaching the Black Tower lined with mausolea containing the mouldering remains of those Dreadlords who thought to take Malekith’s throne for themselves.\\n	false

gen_lore_def_fate_of_the_spirit_description	The Elves are cursed to have their souls devoured by Slaanesh when their mortal bodies perish. The High Elves and the Wood Elves have taken precautions to guard against this fate, sealing their spirits away in waystones and elemental creatures. The Dark Elves, however, have no such defence against the Dark Prince.\\n\\nThey are more than capable of devising one, but refuse to surrender their being to such a hag-life of dulled senses and diminished sensation. The knowledge that naught but oblivion awaits in the end only spurs the Naggarothi to a wilder and more callous existence, for they believe a life lived without limitations or censure is their only compensation.\\n\\nThis is not to say that all Dark Elf souls meet their end as ambrosia for thirsting Slaanesh. A few are delivered by the intercession of other gods. Ereth Khial, the Pale Queen, is always eager to acquire Elves to slave for her in the Underworld, and sends her winged servants to steal souls whilst the Dark Prince’s attentions are elsewhere.\\n\\nOther damned souls are occasionally rescued by Loec, the Trickster, who engages Slaanesh in contests of chance, and then cheats to seize the prize. Such interventions are rare, but frequent enough to kindle some hope of salvation.\\n	false

The boulevards and alleys echo with manic drumming and shrill pipes, while thick clouds of blood-red incense drift around twisted mansions.\\n\\nThrough the smoke prowl roving bands of Witch Elves, murder in their hearts. Under the direction of their Hag Queens they steal away any Dark Elves they find, often breaking into houses to drag the inhabitants to their bloody altars.\\n\\nIt is on Death Night, re-invigorated by the blood of the slain, that the Hag Queens are at their most beautiful and frenetic.

gen_lore_def_feronds_folly_description	The fishing boat Bonadventure rose and fell on the immense swell that preceded the coming storm. A black cloud boiled down from the west at surprising speed and the wind grew into a gale ahead of the thunderhead. Fog spread out from under the black cloud, thickening rather than dissipating in the winds, which struck Arnaud Ferond as somewhat unnatural.\\n\\nThe ship’s captain eyed the storm suspiciously as be called to the masthead, but the lookout could see nothing past the thick fog except the flicker of lightning. Within minutes, the heavy bank of cloud had engulfed the fishing vessel, blanketing every direction in gloom. The only sounds were the slapping of waves against the hull, the occasional rumble of thunder and the discontented murmuring of the crew.\\n\\nTrapped in the cloying mists, Arnaud began to grow even more nervous. Something dark and huge reared up in the shadows and at first the captain thought that they had been turned about and were somehow running aground. The cliff towered higher than anything he’d ever seen. He was about to call for the ship to come about, but the words choked in his throat.\\n\\nThe Bonadventure had broken through a bank of cloud and the full majesty of the Black Ark was revealed; a titanic castle soaring into the storm clouds, floating atop a massive granite outcrop. Winged creatures flapped about its minarets and cruel figures in scaled cloaks leered down from savage battlements.\\n\\nOut of instinct, Arnaud hammered at the warning bell and bellowed out orders. United in their dread, the crew leapt to the sheets to haul the ship onto a new heading, away from the floating citadel. As the fell apparition receded from view, Arnaud let out an explosive sigh of relief.\\n\\nTheir reprieve was short-lived. Water spurned as something burst to the surface ahead of the ship. A gigantic, serpentine beast fully four or five times larger than the Bonadventure surged out of the water. Atop its back was a slender castle, water foaming from its battlements. Arnaud watched in horror as the monster bore down on him, its many eyes alight with a greenish glow.\\n\\nThe crew were screaming and shouting and some hurled themselves from the deck in terror. Arnaud’s last dread-laden vision was of a jaw filled with dagger-like teeth lunging down and the crash of splintering world. The interloper dealt with, the Black Ark crashed on through the waves, its course set for L'Anguille.\\n	false

gen_lore_def_the_nauglir_description	Since their discovery, Cold Ones, known in the Druchii tongue as Nauglir, have become ever more popular as mounts for the so-called nobles of Naggaroth. The natural viciousness of these fearsome beasts resonates with the Dark Elf love of violence. Both rider and mount share a mutual lack of mercy for their prey, which has resulted in many bloody and ferocious slaughters upon the battlefield.\\n\\nThe first Cold Ones were ridden by Amarekh Khail and his companions, who shattered the High Elves’ line at Athel Oreirian. These riders became infamous amongst the High Elves for decades, and were easily recognisable by the banner they flew – a macabre standard made from the bones and skins of those slain in their first battle.\\n\\nThe Cold One chariot regiment known as the Bloodscythes were equally lauded amongst the Naggarothi some three thousand years later. With their distinctive, red-lacquered weapons and armour they became a familiar sight amongst the hosts of Hag Graef and were instrumental in many victories until their leader, Asdrual Severain, fell to an Assassin’s blade. The remnants of the regiment slew each other the ensuing power struggle before the survivors finally disbanded and went their separate ways.\\n\\nSuch infighting is commonplace amongst the arrogant princes who ride these beasts. Two brothers, Venien and Hurien, became renowned generals and jointly led the hosts of House Heghlin in several decisive triumphs during the most recent campaigns in Nagarythe. Despite their success, ultimately they were unable to share the glory.\\n\\nHurien took the cloak of his brother and soaked it in the blood of a mountain boar. When Venien came to attend his mount, the scent, which Venien could not smell due to the sense-numbing elixir he had applied, the Cold One went wild and tore the Dark Elf lord to pieces. Hurien ruled House Heghlin for another fifteen hundred years, never admitting that his brother’s death was anything more than an unfortunate accident.\\n\\nThe oldest Cold One, as far as the Dark Elves know, was named Kintearer and lived for seventeen hundred and thirty two years after it was captured. During this time it served as the mount of three different generals, including Anglan Arheirain, the infamous slayer of Loremaster Menthrith of the White Tower.\\n	false

gen_lore_def_reapers_bloody_toll_description	The tolling of an alarm bell rang out over the rooftops of the squalid coastal town. As Alandriakh watched from amongst the trees upon a nearby hilltop, smoke and flames wreathed the human hovels. He fondly imagined the terrified shouts, the wild eyes of the clumsy humans as they dashed about in panic; their cries of torment as Meurlith’s Corsairs cut them down or bound them in barbed nets.\\n\\nWith a wistful sigh, the Dark Elf returned to the Reaper Bolt Throwers stationed in the copse of trees overlooking the road from the east. Following its course inland, Alandriakh could just about see the squat towers of the castle supposedly protecting this stretch of the shore. He knew that what they did was important, but still it chafed his pride to be so far from the true fighting. \\n\\n“Let us offer prayers to Khaine that we shall see some blood today,” Alandriakh said and in reply received cruel smiles from the crews of the other two Reapers. It was not long before Alandriakh’s keen ears picked up the jingling of harnesses and the thud of hooves on the muddy road. He hissed a warning to his fellows and stepped beside a tree so that he could better see the riders’ approach. They came into view soon enough, rounding a bend at the base of the bill. Twenty knights trotted along the rutted roadway, their armour painfully dull, their banner hanging limply from its pole. Pathetic, thought Alandriakh.\\n\\nThe Dark Elves waited until the knights had almost passed before pivoting their machines upon their target. Alandriakh brought his arm down as the command to fire and the air was filled with hissing bolts. The shouts of men and the whinny of horses greeted the fusillade, which scythed down half a dozen knights with the first salvo. The survivors were thrown into anarchy by the surprise attack, their horses rearing, the riders’ bellowing to each other in confusion. More bolts quickly silenced them and soon the road was littered with armoured corpses and the bloodied remains of their steeds.\\n\\nAlandriakh watched as a few of the knights struggled to rise despite their wounds, while others crawled desperately for the cover of their comrades’ bodies. He drew a curved dagger from his belt and set off down the hill. Perhaps Khaine smiled on him after all.\\n	false

Thus will the Dark King fall, slain by neither blade nor arrow but by a sorcerous power of darkest magic and so shall his body be consumed in the flames and for all eternity burn.”\\n\\nAs Aenarion drew the Blade of Khaine, Caledor was gifted with a prophecy that spoke of the tragedy that would befall Elvenkind. Part of the prophecy talks of a great warrior cast from his home by a sorcerer, and Malekith believes it is he to whom the prophecy refers.\\n\\nAs a result, male Dark Elf wizards are regarded with disdain, fear and superstition, and they cannot be admitted to the Dark Convent.

They attacked him, surrounding his prone body in a dark swarm of menacing lights. Try as he might, he could not fight them; they were too fast and there were too many of them. He tried to run from his attackers, but his feet would not respond. Slowly, the swarm suffocated him, and he was helpless against them.\\n\\nJohann stood at Stefan’s doorway. He desperately needed fresh air to repress the nauseous feeling that had taken control of his entire body. He had been the one to discover Stefan’s body. He knew the image of his friend would haunt him forever – it had swollen to twice its normal size and his clawed hands reached out as if trying to fend off some mysterious attacker.

gen_lore_def_khaine_description	Khaine is the god of murder, hatred and destruction. He is the kindler of war, the ruthless personification of a vicious creed. Khaine believes that: conflict is necessary for peace to reign; only slaughter gives the promise of life any meaning; and love is nothing unless tempered by the blackest of hatreds. He is a god who gives his supplicants license to do as they will, and forbids nothing, save denial of his divine will.\\n\\nIt is, therefore, little wonder that it is Khaine’s blessing the Dark Elves seek most keenly, for their lives are founded upon deeds of slaughter and torment. Where the High Elves treat warily with the Lord of Murder, the Dark Elves embrace him with abandon, sacrificing slaves, comrades and even their own children to catch Khaine’s attention for even a moment.\\n\\nSuch devotion pleases the Bloody-Handed God in a way that the hollow observances of the High Elves never will, but Khaine is easily bored, and each passing year the sacrifices must become ever more wild and barbarous if they are to attract his ruddy gaze.\\n\\nAll Dark Elves are touched by Khaine to some degree, for their heritage is tainted by the Widowmaker and the acts their ancestors performed at Aenarion’s side.

gen_lore_def_ellinill_description	Legend tells that Ellinill once had more than one hundred offspring, each of whom had inherited an aspect of his destructive nature. Together, father and progeny inflicted all manner of disasters upon the world, revelling in the harm they unleashed upon the Elves.\\n\\nEllinill was proud of his children, but he was also paranoid, and worried that they might conspire to supplant him. Individually, the offspring were no match for their sire, but the Lord of Destruction was wary of their combined power, and so he watched them closely.\\n\\nFinally, Isha could bear the suffering of the Elves no more, and pleaded with the other gods to curtail the actions of the Ellinilli. All save one refused to heed her, for they were all wary of provoking Ellinill’s wrath. Only Loec the Trickster answered Isha’s plea, and he soon deceived Ellinill into believing that the long-feared betrayal had arrived.\\n\\nUpon hearing Loec’s words, the Lord of Destruction flew into a rage and, one by one, hunted down and consumed his children, reclaiming the facets of destruction they had once embodied. Yet the battles had weakened Ellinill, and he would never again know the level of godly might he once enjoyed.\\n \\nOf all the Ellinilli, only five survived: Addaioth, Bringer of Wrath and Fire; Estreuth, Herald of Famine and Drought; Hukon the Sunderer; Mathlann, King of Storm and Sea; and Drakira, Queen of Vengeance.

When Ellinill set about devouring his offspring, most fled or attempted to hide. Addaioth did neither, but met his ebon sire in battle. For three days and three nights, son matched father blow for blow in a conflict that shook the heavens and drowned the mortal world in flame.\\n\\nAddaioth knew that he was overmatched, but his hubris made concession unthinkable, and his anger lent him the strength to fight on. Nonetheless, it was a battle that Addaioth could not win. He was sure to have been vanquished had not Ladrielle, Lady of Mists, blinded Ellinill and spirited Addaioth away to the mortal world.\\n\\nAs the millennia passed, Addaioth healed from the grievous wounds he suffered that day, but he has never forgiven Ladrielle for interfering. He knew that the other gods believed him to have fled the field, and the shame of it hangs heavy on him. Nonetheless, the Bringer of Wrath and Fire knows he is destined to fight his father once again, and spares no effort in preparing for that inevitable battle.\\n\\nHe labours beneath the mountains, crafting new weapons to aid his victory. Alas, Addaioth is a poor smith and too proud to ask Vaul for aid, thus every blade he creates is flawed beyond redemption. With each failure, his anger grows, causing the ground to quake and lava to flow.

She has thus ever been an outcast in the eyes of the Elves of Ulthuan. She is, however, a much-courted deity in Naggaroth, for the Dark Elves see their own betrayal echoed in her fate.\\n\\nThe Pale Queen alone offers the Dark Elves some salvation from Slaanesh’s hunger, for her own armies are forged from the stolen souls of the Elf-dead. This is not to say all the Elves who have ever died now labour in Ereth Khial’s service, for countless souls remain bound into waystones and trees, and a far greater number have been consumed by Slaanesh. Yet still, year by year, the Pale Queen’s army grows. One day, her shadow legions will tear down Asuryan’s vaunted creation in payment for his insults of old.\\n\\nThough most Dark Elves care little for the fate of their souls, some fervently worship the Pale Queen, seeking to ensure that she will come to their aid when death claims them. It is for better, they believe, to perform abased service in the Underworld’s grim embrace than to meet oblivion at Slaanesh’s hand. Such ideals are woefully misguided, and it is probably little consolation that most will never find out how mistaken they are – the Dark Prince begrudges even the smallest scraps to fall from his table, and Ereth Khial can risk only the subtlest of thefts.\\n\\nThere is a rumour in Naggaroth, however, that there is one soul Ereth Khial yearns to seize beyond all others.

However, once Eldrazor decides to fight, he does so without mercy.\\n\\nAny tactic is permissible within his Arena of Death, and as he constantly redefines the arena’s bounds in the mortal realm, it is impossible to know you’re within it until it is far too late...\\n	false

gen_lore_def_athari_description	Atharti is the goddess of pleasure and seduction, often depicted as a masked figure entwined with blood-red snakes. She has a profound rivalry with her sister Hekarti, and each has made many attempts to slay the other.\\n\\nThe Lady of Desire is a mistress of all forms of seduction, and the very sight of her is said to cause mortals to collapse in complete and unquestioning abasement. For this reason, those Naggarothi who infiltrate High Elf society count Atharti amongst their foremost patrons, for only she can unlock the hearts and minds of those they wish to corrupt.\\n	false

It is his task to see that those souls claimed by the Pale Queen remain sealed away until the hour of the Rhana Dhandra – the last battle of the gods. It is also Nethu’s duty to see that no intruder breaches the Mirai to steal away the secrets of the dead – at least, not without offering a suitable tribute to the Pale Queen.\\n\\nIn this, the Keeper of the Last Door is aided by a host of Dark Pegasi, who watch unblinkingly from the battlements of his dark fortress, easily mistaken for statuary by the unwary. When roused, none are safe, for their shadowy maws consume soul-stuff as easily as mortal flesh.\\n	false

gen_lore_def_mathlann_description	Mathlann is the King of Storm and Sea, the ruler of the savage creatures of the deep. He is an unpredictable deity, as likely to bestow curses as he is to grant favours, and seemingly makes no distinction between the various races of Elves, only seeing a difference between those who plough his beloved seas, and those who prefer to remain bound to dry land.\\n\\nBlack Ark Corsairs revere Mathlann most highly. In port, this is simply good sense – any Elf who spends so much of his life upon the waves is well-advised to ensure he remains in good standing with the King of Storm and Sea. However, the Corsairs also feel a kinship with Mathlann that transcends mere worship, for they too are a force of destruction that strikes without warning from calm seas, bringing ruin to fleets, ports and coastlines. \\n	false

gen_lore_def_drakira_description	Drakira is the daughter of Ellinill, Lord of Destruction. No affection binds them, for theirs was ever a family bound together only by a shared delight in the suffering they could inflict upon the mortal Elves. Indeed, Drakira was often mocked by her brothers and sisters, for theirs was the power to wreak destruction on a grand scale, whilst hers were subtler gifts whose wicked fruits bloomed only with patient tending. \\n\\nWhen Isha wept for the woes Ellinill’s children inflicted upon the Elves, Drakira saw an opportunity. It was she who shaped Isha’s tears of mourning into bitter shards, who stoked the mother goddess' grief until her desire for retribution burned bright. Thus did Drakira, frailest of the Ellinilli, bring about the fall of her siblings. Those who survived the horror Isha’s grief unleashed were ever careful never to offend their sister again.\\n\\nAll Dark Elves know this story, and are careful to treat the Queen of Vengeance with the respect her family denied her. They believe that she looks favourably upon their vendetta with the High Elves, for what goddess of retribution could possibly deny a people so badly wronged?\\n\\nThe truth is, of course, that Drakira supports the Elves of Ulthuan and Naggaroth in equal measure. The desire for vengeance burns bright on either side of the ocean, and the Queen of Vengeance has no need to take sides. She lends her aid to an Elf in whom the desire for retribution burns bright, regardless of rank or rightness of cause. There is always a price, of course. No act of vengeance leaves the perpetrator entirely as he was, and a bargain with Drakira inevitably costs the supplicant more than he ever intended to give.\\n	false

Aenarion’s children by Astarielle, survived the massacre of Avelorn. As the Daemons cloaked the ancient forest in fire, the Everqueen foresaw the doom of her line, and struck alliances to prevent it.\\n\\nSo it was that Morelion and Yvraine were borne from the fray on the shoulders of the mighty Treeman known in Avelorn as Oakheart. Satisfied with the escape of her offspring, Astarielle remained in Avelorn until the very end, and her fate was so dreadful that the Elves refuse to speak of it.\\n\\nFor decades, Morelion and Yvraine were thought dead – with Avelorn in flames and the Everqueen’s court slaughtered, this was a reasonable enough assumption. Not until after Aenarion’s death was the fate of his children revealed. Ultimately, Yvraine became the new Everqueen, continuing the line unbroken from the dawn of Elven civilisation.\\n\\nMorelion, however, was content to pass into obscurity. He made no claim upon the Phoenix Throne, and retired to Avelorn where he could ensure his sister’s continued safety. His line was ever after a troubled one, for it bore Aenarion’s early light and later darkness in equal measure, yet still brought forth some of the mightiest heroes ever to grace Ulthuan’s shores. \\n	false

gen_lore_hef_phoenix_crown_description	The original Phoenix Crown was created during the time of Aenarion. It was forged not from a single piece of metal, but was crafted from ingots of gold and gemstones brought from the Ten Kingdoms. From the very start, it was deemed that the Phoenix Crown should be derived from all the realms it was to rule.\\n\\nCaledor II was the first, and only, Phoenix King ever to wear the crown to battle. So assured of his superiority was Caledor that he refused to believe that any foe had the strength of arms to wrest it from him. The folly of this course was later proved when the Dwarf King Gotrek Starbreaker took the crown from Caledor's corpse as spoils of war and as recompense for insults suffered. Thus lost in battle, the first Phoenix Crown was never recovered. Even to this day, it rests amidst the hoard of Karaz-a-Karak, a fond memento for the Dwarfs, and an aching wound to High Elf pride.\\n\\nAfter his own rise to the Phoenix Throne, Caradryel soon determined that a replacement crown should be commissioned. The task of forging fell to the priests of Vaul, who undertook the work with all the diligence for which their order was famous, and, after a century’s labour, the new crown was completed.\\n\\nMindful of Caledor’s impetuousness, Caradryel’s first decree whilst wearing the new Phoenix Crown was that this new symbol of Elven kingship would never enter the fires of battle. Furthermore, he announced that the crown would henceforth have a guard of one hundred White Lions of Chrace to watch over it at all times.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_journey_heavens_description	Savan of Tiranoc was one of the few pupils of Caledor the Great not to perish during the creation of the Great Vortex. It was he, more than any other, who ensured that Ulthuan’s legacy of magic was not lost with Caledor, for he undertook the tutelage of many students in the decades following his master’s sacrifice.\\n\\nIn time, Savan found Ulthuan to offer fewer and fewer challenges that matched his wisdom. Casting aside his duties as scholar, he travelled the world, seeking the lost treasures of the Old Ones, and communing with the ancient Slann of the southern jungles. Finally, he returned home to Ulthuan to undertake one last exploration – he would ascend the Annulii Mountains and seek the gods who lived upon the summits.\\n\\nWhen Savan finally returned, all who saw him were shocked to see that his hair, once jet-black, was now white as snow. Worse, where his eyes had once been, there were now only scarred and empty sockets. Savan offered no explanation – indeed, he never spoke thereafter. For the rest of his days, Savan never again attempted so much as a cantrip, and refused all attempts by others to learn of what had occurred beyond the clouds.\\n\\nFinally, after years haunted by terrible dreams, Savan climbed to the top of the tallest tower of his mansion, and threw himself from its balcony. In his death, Savan left one last puzzle. Whilst many servants saw him fall, his body was never found. Whether he was rescued before death, or his corpse taken after – and by whom – was never discovered.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_fate_of_the_body_description	As with all else in Ulthuan, the funerary traditions of High Elves are bound tight by millennia of precedent, protocol and, above all, seemliness. That said, the precise rituals vary greatly with different realms and families holding fast to different traditions.\\n\\nIn Lothern, it is customary to lay a great hero in a funerary ship, which is then set adrift upon the Sea of Dreams to meet whatever fate may claim it. In Caledor, bodies are put to the flame, in order to more quickly free the spirit within. In Tiranoc and Ellyrion, realms where the connection to the land is strongest felt, great stone sepulchres are sunk into the ground, with whole generations of families laid out in silent repose upon slabs of marble and serpentinite.\\n\\nThe Elves of Cothique are of a more practical mind. Seeing the bodies of the slain as naught but empty vessels, they cast cadavers into the waves. Thus are Cothique’s halls not only kept untainted by the dead, but the megalodons and Sea Dragons of the Cothiquan coast kept accustomed to a hunger for fresh meat.\\n\\nIt is even said that in the heart of Avelorn there is a subterranean labyrinth of amber and jade. There, or so the legend tells, the empty shells that once belonged to Handmaidens of the Everqueens sit upon thrones of ivory, their silken robes adorned with enough gemstones to drive a mortal mad with avarice.\\n\\nYet such is the extreme lifespan of Elves that it is not always easy to determine when death has occurred. Some nobles lie in state for hundreds of years, their families convinced they have merely slipped into a long sleep, and will awaken in their own good time. Some Elven princesses have ‘slept’ for centuries, with fresh flowers – and sometimes even suitors – brought to their bedside each day by servants or relatives.\\n	false

The second was the Amulet of Sunfire, which brought hope to those in despair. but whose fury no evil creature could abide.\\n\\nThe last gift was the Moon Staff, into which it was said the goddess had poured much of her power, so much did she love the Elves. Alas, only the Moon Staff has survived to the reign of Finubar the Seafarer – the other gifts have long since been lost to the tides of ruin and war.\\n\\nThe Star Crown was shattered during Malekith’s first assault on Saphery. To this day, the Loremasters of Hoeth search in desperation for the lost fragments of the Star Crown. Even the merest shard of the crown contains great power, and many an Elven mage dreams of harnessing that might to his own ends.\\n\\nThe Amulet of Sunfire was lost forever during Morvael’s reign. Against the counsel of Hoeth’s Loremasters, the Phoenix King gifted it to his son, Aravael, as the prince took ship for a distant land. Alas, Prince Aravael never reached his destination, but was spirited to a watery grave in the depths of the Churning Gulf – the Amulet of Sunfire has never been seen since.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_warriors_mark_description	For the High Elves, long hair is a symbol of strength, power and nobility – the clearest token of a real warrior. Because of this, locks of hair are also important talismans for the Elves. This ancient custom stems from the greatest heroes of Elf legend, who have always been depicted with long flowing hair, and it is said that it is from here that their might springs.\\n\\nThe White Lions of Chrace. who are renowned for their prodigious strength, take great pride in their hair, which grows golden or jet-black. They weave delicate iron cords into their long plaits so they will not be cut in the heat of the battle, as this would mean that the warrior so divested would become weakened in the midst of war.\\n\\nAll High Elves decorate their hair with combs made of silver or gold, and embellished with bright gems. Each jewel has a different meaning, and reflects the Elf’s role in his family, his rank in battle, or can even be a token of favour granted by a betrothed.\\n\\nWoe betide a battlefield scavenger who takes one of these adornments from a fallen Elf; the High Elves consider this deed to be an insult almost beyond reckoning, and pursue it as such. The Bretonnian town of Brigadine’s fire-blackened ruins stand as grim reminder that, no matter how pretty an Elf-wrought comb might look amidst the curls of a knight’s chosen lady, the suitor would have done far better to trade in gold than pluck one from the battlefield dead.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_khaine_description	Khaine is the Elf god of war, murder, hatred and destruction. He is the destroyer, who represents to the Elves the fact that in order for there to be life there must also be death; in order to have peace there must also be war; in order to have happiness there must be suffering; in order to have love there must be hatred and murder. Without Khaine, and his ruthless arts, life would be utterly without meaning, for no living being appreciates life’s bounty without the prospect of it being torn asunder.\\n\\nKhaine is the god of unleashed violence – the High Elves may use his murder-lust when danger threatens, but it must be controlled and used wisely. The nobility of Nagarythe in particular are wary of the lure of Khaine’s glories, for they are born of a lineage that thirsts for vengeance and know the seductive call of the Bloody-Handed God better than any. For a warrior of Nagarythe, every day is lived in perfect balance, drawing upon Khaine when he is needed, but countering his baleful influence with that of more merciful gods, lest his influence overwhelm.\\n\\nOnce you have fallen into Khaine’s shadow, the High Elves say, you will never rest easy in the light. The history of Ulthuan contains many stark reminders of this singular truth, but none carry more weight than the fate of Aenarion. Once the Phoenix King seized the Widowmaker, he invited Khaine into his heart, and thereafter knew peace only in death.\\n	false

She is the goddess of dreams and fortune, and commonly revered by the seers, Loremasters and mages of Ulthuan. Indeed, no High Elf care truly master the arts of magic without receiving Lileath’s blessing. Indeed, it is even said that this divine favour – as much as scholarly discipline – is what grants the mages of Ulthuan their incomparable aptitude for abjuration and counterspell.\\n\\nLileath is also the Elven goddess associated with innocence and forgiveness. It is claimed that she reads the intent written upon the heart of an Elf and thus judges his actions not by what he does, but by what he seeks to do.\\n\\nWhat is less well known is the special relationship that the Shadow Warriors share with Lileath. She alone is their hope for salvation. If the ill-fated warriors of Nagarythe can finally defeat Malekith’s followers and fulfil the oath sworn by their ancestors centuries ago, they believe that the Maiden will forgive them the grievous wrongs they have committed while carrying out their grisly shadow war.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_vaul_description	Vaul is armourer to the hosts of heaven and patron to blacksmiths and artisans. He is both crippled and blind, wounded in the ancient wars of the gods when he challenged Khaine. Enslaved to Khaine’s will, Vaul is forced to make weapons of extraordinary power for the War God’s eternal battle against the great enemy.\\n\\nVaul has thus laboured for time untold, but his hatred for Khaine has never slackened. Even so, the Maker nurtures no seed of rebellion, but bears his shame in silence; he knows that the Elves will need Khaine’s fire and fury if they are to survive the great darkness that is coming, and even a god’s pride is a little thing when set against the extinction of an entire race. So does Vaul’s desire for revenge go unfulfilled – just one more burden for his twisted body to bear.\\n\\nMightiest of the blades forged at Vaul’s hand was the Widowmaker, and it was Draugnir, father of Dragons, who provided the fire that tempered that steel. Alas, the weapon thirsted, even then, and stole from Draugnir more than he sought to give. Thereafter, the fate of Draugnir’s line was eternally bound to that of the Elves.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_morai_heg_description	Morai-Heg is an ancient and withered creature, the Keeper of the Souls and the Weaver of Prophecy. She, and she alone, knows the future and reads the patterns of time. She sets the stars of the heavens, and thus the future can be read from the night sky. The High Elves believe that Morai-Heg knows the fate of all, and that every death – no matter how trivial – is foretold by the Crone.\\n\\nMorai-Heg is a vexsome and shifting being, and commonly stands apart from the quarrels of the other gods. Hers is not the distant aloofness practiced by Asuryan, however, but a scheming neutrality that exploits any heavenly discord to her own advantage. Thus, there is not a god of the Elves who does not owe Morai-Heg thanks and retribution in equal measure.\\n\\nRavens are said to be Morai-Heg’s messengers. They soar across Ulthuan and the barbaric lands of the younger races, bearing snippets of the Crone Goddess’ wisdom to those that have the wit to interpret the signs. Thus, Ulthuan’s archer regiments hark at every coarse raven song, and mourn the passing of each member of the chorus.\\n\\nSuch actions are thought to be the obsessions of simple minds by some of the nobility, but the archers care not. It does not do to mock Morai-Heg, they say. She knows whether the arrows they loose will find their mark or not and such knowledge grants power that should not be offended.\\n	false

Opinion is divided on precisely why Hoeth did so.\\n\\nMost Elves believe Hoeth’s actions were founded in generosity, but some mutter darkly of how knowledge leads to progress, and progress inevitably leads to the ruin of tradition. Whatever the motivation, legend tells that when Asuryan learned of Hoeth’s actions, he rebuked the Lord of Wisdom and, in punishment, set much of Hoeth’s great library ablaze.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_ereth_khial_description	Ereth Khial is the supreme goddess of the Underworld. Long ago, she attempted to seduce Asuryan and, when he resisted her, she grew enraged, stole the souls of the dead and hid them in the black pit, Mirai. The Pale Queen has never forgotten Asuryan’s slight. Whilst he lies beyond her power, the Elves do not, so it is they who suffer Ereth Khial’s wrath.\\n\\nShould a waystone be destroyed, Ereth Khial sends the wraith-like rephallim to seize what souls they may, and bear them away to dwell in Mirai in eternal torment. Such thievery must be quick, for Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos, suffers no one – not even the Pale Queen – to take even the meanest of scraps from his table.\\n\\nEreth Khial’s deeds may have made her outcast from Asuryan’s court, but many of the Elves’ darker deities acknowledge her as their mistress. Even so, she is seldom worshipped in Ulthuan. Most folk do not entreat Ereth Khial’s blessings, but hope to avoid her attention altogether, wearing sprigs of wyrdroot or blackhame to avert her vengeful gaze. Some Elves, however, think it better for their spirits to endure eternity in torment, rather than meet oblivion through Slaanesh’s hunger, and thus secretly court the Pale Queen’s fickle favour.\\n\\nSuch observances must perforce be kept secret, for the worship of Ereth Khial is widely considered the sign of a diseased or ill-adjusted mind. Those marked by the Pale Queen’s touch are inevitably exiled or imprisoned should their terrible secrets be laid bare, yet her priests and celebrants have never been entirely eradicated from Ulthuan’s shores.\\n	false

The Elf legends tell that he often saves the souls of the dead from Slaanesh by tricking the Dark Prince out of his prize. And such is true, though no rescue is guaranteed, and even successes cost the Shadow Dancer more of his strength than he would care to admit.\\n\\nLoec appears to the Elves as a lithe youth who dances across the void, and his laughter stirs the souls and spirits that dwell there. Without him, it is said, the heavens would grow dull and cold, for the stars of the night sky would no longer have reason to remain wakeful. The Chaos Gods hunt Loec as he dances, but the Shadow Dancer is tireless and cunning, and can never be caught.\\n\\nThere is a darker side to Loec as well. He is the god of shadows, malicious trickery, vengeance and dark deeds. The Elves of lost Nagarythe worship him, for they use stealth and darkness to enact their revenge.\\n	false

He is the husband of Isha, and all Elves are his children. Wherever Kurnous travels, he is followed by a pack of baying hounds, and when he sounds his horn the Wild Hunt follows him, their hearts filled with unrestrained joy.\\n\\nAll hunters venerate Kurnous, for he watches over them in the wilds. He requires that a hunter never kills animals for sport, but slays only dangerous beasts, and hunts only enough game to eat. To offend Kurnous is to invite disaster, for his vengeance is swift and brutal. Those that transgress his laws are well served not to enter those places where the natural world is at its wildest; few that do so emerge from the untamed lands, and those that do escape are invariably ashen-faced, scarred and silent for the remainder of their lives.\\n\\nEllyrion is considered by many to be Kurnous’ chosen kingdom in Ulthuan, for its wide plains and dense forests are home to many wild beasts against which a hunter can test his skill. Many a hollow conceals an altar of horn, bone and briar where Kurnous’ adherents make their observances away from the prying eyes of more civilised Elves.\\n\\nSometimes, the wind on plains carries the echo of the Hunter God’s horn. If heard at dawn, it is considered to be a good omen for that day’s hunt. If heard at dusk, it is Kurnous’ warning that evil stalks the land, and that all hunters must ready their bows for two-legged prey.\\n	false

He is the Creator, and the Flame Eternal – the giver of life – rests in his hand. The High Elves believe that it is Asuryan’s purpose and plan that they follow in mortal life and beyond. Whether this is true or not is impossible to say, for Asuryan speaks seldom to his fellow gods, and hardly ever to the Elves.\\n\\nAsuryan dwells alone in a great pyramid atop the heavens, and observes the world from his diamond throne. No mortal has ever seen his face, and thus the statues of him always bear a mask. The mask is divided in two halves, one white and the other black, symbolising Asuryan’s role as the Keeper of Balance.\\n\\nAsuryan is the judge between the disputes of the gods and rarely meddles in the affairs of the Elves – indeed, few mortal deeds or plights are significant enough to attract his attention. However, legend tells that it is Asuryan who touches the mind of each new Phoenix King of Ulthuan when he passes through the Flames of Asuryan, in order to better judge their worthiness for the task ahead.\\n	false

She is depicted as an Elf woman full of life and beauty and is considered to be the mother of the whole Elven race. It is Isha who blesses the Everqueen with wisdom, beauty and power, and she also who preserves the eternal glades of Avelorn from the blemish of winter.\\n\\nThe symbol of Isha is the All Seeing Eye, shedding a single tear for her mortal children, the Elves. At the dawn of time Asuryan decided that while the Elves would be prodigiously long-lived, they would still grow weary of the world and die. Isha, who loved her children the Elves above all her creations, despaired and cried in anguish, her tears falling like rain onto the mortal world below, providing the waters of life that transformed Ulthuan into such a rich and bountiful land.\\n\\nThereafter, Isha has ever watched her mortal children keenly, ever alert to ways in which she might aid them. Whilst direct contact has long been forbidden by Asuryan, Isha sometimes pleads with Lileath to send tidings through dreams and nightmares, so that the Elves might not confront the perils of the world without some measure of warning and guidance. Only when the Creator’s attention is elsewhere does Isha dare intervene personally, spreading her magics across Ulthuan to shrivel the Daemons and evildoers that threaten her children.\\n	false

Some realms are permanently locked in time, and only ever experience a single season as the years pass. Others dwell eternally under the night, or in the glory of the noon-day sun.\\n\\nScattered throughout the glades of these realms are the magical halls of the lords and ladies, their mighty entrance doors woven from the trunks of ancient trees or delved into the hillside. They are hidden to those the Elves do not welcome, and many an interloper has passed within a few paces of such a portal without knowing it was there.\\n\\nThose who enter through one of these strange gateways find themselves in a series of grand, beautiful caverns deep below the tree or hill. Roots can be seen far above, curving down from the roof of the hall to form elegant, interweaving pillars set with silver and gemstones. Everywhere there is ghostly music, soft glowing light and laughter that sounds like the wind blowing through autumnal trees.\\n\\nIt is in these halls that the Wood Elves feast and celebrate the natural cycles of the forest, holding grand banquets of woodland game and free-flowing, intoxicating Elven wines. Children taken from the lands around the forest, destined never to grow old, joyfully serve their graceful Elven masters.\\n\\nThe halls are alive with wild dancing, lilting laughter and melodic music. It is not unheard of for outsiders, such as Bretonnian questing knights, to on occasion join an Elven feast, but it is a foolish individual indeed that would eat or drink the foodstuffs of the Elves without invitation.\\n	false

It is a realm of grim prophecy and stark terror, of endless magic and daemonic malice.\\n\\nThe Wood Elves enter the Dreaming Wood only at times of greatest need, for they know well that there is no surer way to draw thirsting Slaanesh’s attention. The Dark Prince’s servants ever prowl Athel Caiellin, searching for errant Elves and battling with others of their kind.\\n\\nAthel Caiellin can only be accessed in places where magic lies heavily upon the land. Many of these sites fluctuate with the passage of the seasons, and only serve as portals at high summer, or in the darkest depths of winter.\\n\\nMost of these locations are marked by archways of vine-tangled white stone, placed as warning to the unwary that the Dreaming Wood lies beyond. Others are given away only by dark whispers on the breeze and a slight shimmering of the air, beyond which the glades take on a strangely sinister or unwelcoming aspect.\\n	false

gen_lore_wef_kurnous_the_hunter_description	Kurnous is the God of the Hunt, and the lord of wild places. All Elves venerate him, for he is the husband of Isha, and the father of their race, but none do so more than the Wood Elves, who believe that it is only they that live the existence of which Kurnous would approve.\\n\\nKurnous requires that a hunter never kills animals for sport, but slays only ravening beasts or those whose bounty of meat and hide are necessary for survival. Violating this creed is dangerous the world over, for Kurnous is a vengeful deity, but it is never more foolish than when in Athel Loren.\\n	false

Wood Elf legend tells that, in times past, Isha was forbidden from treating directly with her mortal children by Asuryan, the Emperor of the Heavens.\\n\\nHowever, those same legends go on to tell that Isha and her consort, the Hunter God Kurnous, chafed at Asuryan’s decree and, after the Elven pantheon was scattered and defeated by the Dark Gods of Chaos, chose to take mortal form amongst the only Elven people who had stayed true to their teachings. Thus, tell the Wood Elves, were Ariel and Orion reborn as something more than mortal, and Athel Loren transformed into a realm divinely blessed.\\n	false

It was to guard against subversion that Ariel placed the very first Wild Riders under an oath of secrecy that has since bound all who have worn the hunter’s mantle.\\n\\nOnly one Wild Rider, in all the years since, has broken that geas. His name was Atherin of the Red Horn, and he did so not under duress, nor out of promise of wealth or godly favour, but to impress his beloved, Kalara, a princess of Wydrioth, by speaking of those hallowed secrets.\\n\\nLegend tells that Atherin was struck dumb in the moment of his betrayal and, sensing a greater change overtaking him, fled from his love’s side and deep into the forest where no other would witness his shame. Kalara was distraught with her loss, but no amount of searching or sorcerous scrying would reveal Atherin to her.\\n\\nA long and mournful year passed. Kalara resolved to appease Kurnous on her lover’s behalf, and embarked upon a hunt in his name. For many months she roamed the glades and fields of Athel Loren, searching for a quarry worthy of the Hunter God.\\n\\nAt last, on the windswept plains of Eldroth, she beheld a suitable prey, a mighty stag with a full and glorious crown of antlers. In one smooth motion, Kalara nocked an arrow to her bow, and let fly. The princess did not miss her mark. The shot took the stag in his right eye, and the beast fell dead in that same moment.\\n\\nEager to begin the rites that would dedicate the kill to Kurnous, Kalara spurred her steed forward through the long grass. Alas, she found no trace of the stag, but lying amongst the grasses she discovered the naked and lifeless body of her lost love, an arrow buried deep in his skull.\\n\\nThus passed Atherin of the Red Horn, though his tale lives ever on as a warning to those who might be tempted to betray Kurnous’ trust. As for Kalara, she wandered, broken-hearted and desolate, for many turnings of the world, unable to forgive herself for the part she had played in Atherin’s death. Only in Athel Loren’s darkest hour would she find redemption, but that is another story...\\n	false

Wood Elves are no exception, and there are many skilled practitioners of their own particular fey strand of magic within the bounds of Athel Loren.\\n\\nWood Elf mages tend to follow the path of the ancient Elven god of renewal and rebirth, Isha, and are oft sometimes known as the Handmaidens or Stewards of Ariel. Skilled in the arts of spell-weaving, they are able to manipulate the energies of Athel Loren in many varied ways.\\n\\nThey are adept at creating powerful illusions and glamours, as well as being masters in the mystical arts of healing and regrowth. They are capable of weaving spells of confusion and trickery that can ensure that an intruder will be unable to discover an Elven hall, even if he walks only feet from its majestic doors; they can cast dangerous blasts that strip trespassers of their wits and memories, and heal grievous wounds with but the touch of a hand.\\n\\nThey are capable of encouraging trees and undergrowth to spontaneous growth, which can then be directed to create elegant and artful forms. In this manner, the Elves can create beautiful artistry, such as delicately twisting pillars of living branches that form the basis of graceful monuments and structures.\\n\\nTrees and foliage can be encouraged by skilful Wood Elf mages to uproot and move about, blocking off paths and creating new glades. This is often used as a subtle warning, and most will be so unnerved by this that they leave Athel Loren immediately, but those that choose to ignore such warnings are dealt with without mercy.\\n\\nOther Wood Elf mages specialise in learning the secret magical paths of Athel Loren, enabling them to disappear like smoke, only to reappear in a completely different location. Wood Elf mages are capable of all manner of fey sorceries and artful spells, and are rightly feared by all.\\n	false

After the First War against Chaos we stood victorious, and all of Ulthuan was in our debt.\\n\\nAenarion was slain in battle and, quite rightfully, his son Malekith requested the sceptre of Ulthuan for himself, for he was son of the King. born to rule, and the only Elf with a legal claim to the throne. But there were jealous lords, petty princes of lesser kingdoms who opposed noble Malekith with all their might.\\n\\nRather than start a civil war, in his infinite wisdom Malekith suggested a vote for the throne. The ungrateful curs cast their votes and chose one of their own to take a task which was far beyond his capabilities. It was an outrageous insult to all of Nagarythe, and yet Malekith was first to acknowledge the rule of the lesser Elf, Bel Shanaar the Explorer, better known in our legends as the Pedlar-king.\\n\\nOver the years, Lord Malekith became ever more concerned. The enemies of the Elves had not disappeared, but Bel Shanaar did nothing to counter these threats. Long Malekith worked to strengthen the realm, but it was to no avail. Instead of facing the threat of the Dwarfs, who were bound to become our future enemies, Bel Shanaar cultivated peace agreements with the stunted folk.\\n\\nBlinded by greed, he encouraged trade with the hairy ones when he should have prepared for war.

The Cult of Pleasure produced the greatest songs of the age and Elves like Oeric and Aesabai made the most delicate and lifelike sculptures to grace the Gardens of Delight of Lady Morathi. Never has such beauty graced the known world, and not until we have claimed our rightful lands will it be recreated!\\n\\nBut the princes of other kingdoms grew envious and coveted the riches of Nagarythe. They falsely accused Lady Morathi of treason and claimed that the Cult of Pleasure which she led planned to overthrow the king. Seeing no other way to save his people and his blood-kin from outright war, Lord Malekith called upon all his cunning and devised a plan to save the kingdom. He took control of the investigations into the innermost matters of the Cult, turning the agents of the Phoenix King against the petty princes who plotted the downfall of Nagarythe.\\n\\nBut in the end, Malekith had no choice but to summon the Lords of Ulthuan to the Shrine of Asuryan to reveal the greatest traitor of all. Here Lord Malekith took Bel Shanaar to the Chamber of Days in the Shrine. Therein rests the Stone of Destiny which shows the events of the future in fiery letters, and here was revealed the eventual downfall of the Elves, thanks to the incompetence of Bel Shanaar.\\n\\nBel Shanaar, confronted with the magnitude of his failure, took poison as the traitor he was. Now Malekith prepared to save Elvenkind. But upon hearing of Bel Shanaar’s death the petty princes drew their swords against Lord Malekith. Fools! They were like children facing a god. Long did Malekith try to make them see their folly, but finally he was forced to cut them down to defend his life.\\n\\nTo claim his rightful throne, Malekith donned the Feathered Cloak and stepped into the flames of Asuryan, for this is the way that the ruler of all Elven kingdoms is crowned to his office. But the envious princes had foreseen our Lord’s rightful bid for the throne and cast vile curses upon the Flames of Asuryan. In the most tragic event of Druchii history, our lord was horribly scarred by the cursed flames, and his servants took him back to the north, to be nursed back to health by Lady Morathi and her priestesses.\\n	false

They placed a Caledorian thug known as Imrik on the throne and, after assuming the name Caledor, this ruthless tyrant started amassing armies to slay Malekith whom he greatly, and rightly, feared.\\n\\nSoon armies of the pretender threatened our borders, and finally we were forced to draw arms against our misguided and envious brothers. The spearmen and archers of Cothique, the charioteers of Tiranoc and the cavalry of Ellyrion trampled the fields of Nagarythe underfoot.\\n\\nBut we knew great sorceries and no decadent Elven kingdom could match the glory of our arms. The lords of Chrace, Cothique, Ellyrion and Tiranoc could not withstand us, but fled howling before our weapons back to their pitiful abodes, there to brood, lick their wounds and plot petty revenge.\\n\\nSeeking to end the bloodshed once and for all, we pursued them, cutting through the traitorous kingdoms of Tiranoc and Ellyrion like a fiery sword. From all over the Elven kingdoms those loyal to the rightful king Malekith gathered. From Saphery came the great mages who had cast their auguries and had seen the just cause of our Lord Malekith. From Caledor came skilled priests who had grown disillusioned with the cripple god Vaul, and offered their services as weaponsmiths.\\n\\nWhile war raged, King Malekith called his armourers to him and, aided by Hotek, a wise and just noble who had once followed Vaul, they fashioned an unrivalled suit of armour. The king then mounted his Dragon and was made ready for battle, and the glorious armies of Nagarythe loyally followed behind him. Thus began the Longest War, and it will end when the last of our repugnant cousins is dragged screaming to the altar of Khaine.\\n\\nSeven great battles Malekith fought, and he won them all, but Caledor the Traitor rallied numberless hordes of his kin, bound by lies and empty promises.

For this deed he was slain by Kithan the Master Assassin, and to this day daemons rend his soul in the Void.\\n\\nIt has been claimed that the power of Chaos could have escaped from our control, but I was there, and I knew our strength was sufficient. We were and are the masters of Chaos, and the howling powers of the Void are our servants.\\n\\nBut the twisted scholars of Hoeth, alarmed by Urathion, disturbed the shades of the deceased resting in the Isle of Dead and their ghastly spells unleashed a terrible force to sink the lands of Nagarythe. A tidal wave, fully one thousand feet high, crashed upon our beautiful lands.\\n\\nTo save our people from this cataclysm, the wizards of King Malekith cast great spells and the palaces and fortresses of Nagarythe broke free and floated on the surface of waves and amongst the skies. Thus were created the Black Arks, and our folk survived, preserving our legacy. But our great and beautiful kingdom was drowned under the waves. We grieved the wrongs done to us and swore revenge.\\n\\nWe did not need great patience for a chance to exact our vengeance, for Caledor built a navy and dared to bring it against our mighty Black Arks and wave-dancing vessels for many years, until our spells brought a storm upon his fleet and separated his ships. Our glorious fleet, which ruled the waves then as it does now, descended upon him.\\n\\nRather than face the rightful king and his justice, Caledor took the coward’s way out and committed suicide, jumping into the sea in full armour.

We scoured the lands, exterminated and enslaved the repulsive human barbarians who lived there, and prepared for the war that was to come.\\n\\nOur masons built six great cities that were divided amongst the lords of our folk. Naggarond, the Tower of Chill, was reserved for King Malekith. Ghrond was granted to the Dark Coven under Lady Morathi, and Har Ganeth served as the bastion of the Cult of Khaela Mensha Khaine, the Bloody-Handed God.\\n\\nHag Graef, Karond Kar, and Clar Karond, the port of our navy, were divided between the king’s most loyal followers. It took us many long years to erect our towers and build our defences, and meanwhile our kin in Ulthuan found new enemies: the race of Dwarfs in the distant lands of the east.\\n\\nSome have said that it was us Druchii who incensed the Ugly Folk against the effete princes of Ulthuan. But know now that these things are mere lies and worse than lies. The Dwarfs hardly needed an excuse to begin the war, and our misguided cousins were quick to start hostilities. Thus was Malekith’s prediction proved correct, and the Dwarfs became the enemies of the Elf race.\\n\\nFor an entire age, the armies of the pretender ruler of Ulthuan and the Dwarf kings slew each other, and how we laughed at the reports of their folly! It is a testimony of the weakness of Ulthuan that they failed to crush these upstarts swiftly and mercilessly.

For centuries our ancestral lands were ours to rule and govern and, despite the necessities of war, prosperity and unsoiled heritage flourished.\\n\\nBut then Tethlis the Butcher, the scourge of life, was elected to rule Ulthuan.

He displayed new depths of corruption, so low had his kind sunken. As we built our navy and sent our armies to consolidate our hold over the northlands, he emptied the coffers of Ulthuan to build a tower of colossal proportions to match his ego. Here he collected decadent works of ‘art’ and filled his court with sycophants and courtiers who eroded the last vestiges of the Elven spirit.\\n\\nThus our weakling kin studied poetry, dancing, gardening and other nonsense, and we watched gleefully how they ran down their armies and forgot the last of the noble military tradition of our past. Truly they had become less than nothing, and scarcely worthy of bearing the name of Elves, the First Speakers. But we, with our memories burnt into our minds by the heat of battle, had forgotten nothing of our knowledge, and our wisdom grew over the centuries of Hateful Peace.\\n\\nDuring these years we built and planned. The warbands of Chaos worshippers had long harried our northern border, and thus King Malekith in his wisdom ordered the construction of a series of fortresses to guard our lands. From that day on the rampaging Chaos hordes were kept in check. Our Black Arks established colonies in the southern continent of Lustria and in the far lands of Cathay. We fought many wars against the Dragon Throne of Cathay, and our victorious armies brought back many wonders of the East to enrich our kingdom and fill the Witch King’s treasuries.\\n\\nYears flew by and centuries passed. Yet another new king rose in Ulthuan, even more decadent than Bel-Korhandis, and we seized our chance. Even if we would have been allowed to choose the next so-called Phoenix, we could have hardly found a more inept ruler than Aethis the Weakling, the poet-king of Saphery.\\n\\nAethis completely neglected the armed forces and the navy like the fool he was. With the guard of Ulthuan down, we struck secretly, silently, and yet with all the customary power of Druchii. The bravest of our kin, and most talented in intrigue and webs of politics, went secretly to Ulthuan, and over the years their influence spread. We eventually had agents even at the court of the Phoenix King. They spread rumours of the death of great Malekith, lulling the toads of Ulthuan into a false sense of security. In secret we controlled much of the Elven kingdoms, without our lazy, blinded former kin ever suspecting.\\n\\nFor long years our agents fought their shadow war, but finally the order of Swordmasters of Hoeth turned against us. This brotherhood of oppressors and murderers was a most bitter enemy to our cause, and many heroes lost their lives in public executions – though many wrong suspects died as well, I might add, for we had woven our web of deception with care and attention.\\n\\nFinally the ringleader of our agents, Girathon the King’s Councillor, was unmasked. Threatened with torture, he decided to fight like a true Elf and slew the weakling Aethis. This plunged Ulthuan into chaos, and for this deed the name of Girathon shall be gloried forever in our legends.\\n	false

An entire fleet, an armada of hundreds of ships, sailed into our trap and was annihilated at the Sea of Chill. We left none alive, and took our revenge for the sack of Anlec.\\n\\nWith the navy of Ulthuan crippled, our long-prepared counter-offensive was unleashed, spearheaded by drugged and screaming human slave warriors. Once more we erected the towers of Anlec, and reconquered all our lands between the isles and the Griffon Gate. These were the heady days of our glory. Victory after victory was ours, and countless numbers died on the altars of Khaine.\\n\\nDesperate, the lords of Ulthuan sent all of their sons to war: potters, carpenters and dung-caked fanners. We slaughtered these lambs in their thousands. The only right decision Morvael made was to appoint Menethus of Caledor as his general. He actually gave us quite some sport.\\n\\nWith a huge numerical superiority of peasants and merchants, he finally pushed us back. We sprang ambushes and fought a fighting withdrawal, for we were loath to give up our ancestral lands easily. For each Druchii life lost we took the souls of ten lackeys of Morvael.\\n\\nFinally, we were forced to abandon Anlec and cast the great Black Arks adrift once more. Satisfied with the destruction of the armies of Ulthuan, we returned to Nagarythe, where already we were assembling our reserves. Upon hearing how many warriors he had lost, Morvael cast himself to the flames of Asuryan.\\n\\nHe was the third Phoenix King to take his own life. Ha!

The black stone tablets of Naggarond were carved so the legacy of our past would be carried to the generations that are to come. In the distant lands of the east we routed the armies of Cathay and took one hundred thousand prisoners in a single day.\\n\\nIn the southern jungles of Lustria we discovered the last rotten fruits of the civilisation of the Old Ones. We slew their reptilian guardians and ransacked their ruined temples, bringing their golden glyph plaques to our cities. From these our sorceresses gleaned much magical lore unknown to our enemies.\\n\\nWe now hold the knowledge of the great magics of the past which unleashed Chaos upon this world, and know how to bend the Four Great Powers to our will. Yes, we have become the ultimate masters of sorcery.\\n\\nOur gold and tales of the riches of Elven kingdoms lured the savage Norse to harry the coasts of Ulthuan, weakening their navy and creating confusion. With our spells we ensorcelled the Dragons of Caledor so they would slumber deeply and could not be roused against us in war.\\n\\nJust three hundred years ago, we made a pact with our old enemies, the lords of Chaos, and our combined armies took the Blighted Isle and lands of Nagarythe. The Plague Fleet and the Black Arks swept the seas clear of Ulthuan’s navy.\\n\\nOur lord Malekith himself returned to the soil of his rightful kingdom. With his leadership we won a score of great battles, and all the lands of Ulthuan save for Caledor, Saphery and the city of Lothern were under our dominion.\\n\\nBut thanks to the incompetence of our Chaos allies and the twice-accursed brothers Tyrion and Teclis, the final battle was lost, though much of Ulthuan was devastated. We recalled our armies and the Witch King himself had to escape through the dark dimensions of the Void.\\n\\nThe current era is, to my mind, a time of consolidation and renewal.

Kolgar stumbled and his helm was pitched from his head as the third rank of Elves stabbed their spears into his men and he heard more screams.\\n\\nLooking into the steely eyes of his foes, Kolgar felt his blood run cold. There was no fear upon the faces of the Elves, only ruthless determination. With a silent prayer to Khorne, Kolgar hoped the Blood God was with him.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_secret_war_description	Since the time of Bel Shanaar, a long and bitter struggle has raged behind the peaceful facade of Ulthuan’s courts and palaces. A war fought behind closed doors by the trusted agents of the Phoenix King and the debased worshippers of the Cults of Excess.\\n \\nAfter centuries of bitter struggle, Phoenix King Aethis requested aid from the sages of the White Tower. In response, the Loremasters of Hoeth unleashed the Sword Masters upon the vile cultists. The legendary warrior-scholars wasted no time taking their unparalleled skills to the dark corners of Ulthuan’s great cities, slaughtering the cultists wherever they were found.\\n\\nSo began the first chapter in the secret war that has lasted ever since, for the Sword Masters are implacable foes and will not rest until every member of the Cult of Pleasure lies dead.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_rulers_of_ulthuan_description	Ulthuan is ruled by a collection of princes, princesses and mages, above whom preside the Phoenix King and the Everqueen. The relationship between these rulers is not as simple as the titles would suggest. The kingship is elective while the queenship is hereditary, and both monarchs maintain entirely separate courts.\\n\\nThe Everqueen is always the Queen of Avelorn. Her realm is the site of the principal shrine of the Earth Mother, and she is regarded as the spiritual leader of the whole Elven realm. The position of Everqueen is always taken up by the firstborn daughter of the previous queen, conceived during her year-long ritual marriage to the Phoenix King.\\n\\nAfter this formal marriage, they are free to take new consorts, but only the daughter conceived from the marriage of the Phoenix King and the Everqueen can be the new Everqueen. Hence the Queens of Avelorn have always been the Everqueens of Ulthuan, forming an unbroken chain from ages past.\\n\\nBy contrast, the Phoenix King is chosen from among the princes of Ulthuan, one year after the death of the previous incumbent. Each is crowned during a holy ceremony, held at the massive pyramidal Shrine of Asuryan and attended by the legions of the Phoenix Guard and the princes of Ulthuan.\\n\\nThe process of choosing the new Phoenix King is rife with intrigue. Emotions often run hot during this fraught and delicate event. Traditionally, the last thirty days of the year of mourning are set aside for the election to take place; however, in practice the debate starts much sooner than that.\\n\\nOften, the politicking starts long before the reigning Phoenix King has died. High Elves love intrigue, and never is the prize greater than when a new Phoenix King is chosen. The grandest of Ulthuan’s noble families each look for their candidate to be chosen, and they vie for the support of their peers for their choice, Further to this, each realm in Ulthuan desires the new Phoenix King to be chosen from their land. So it is that rivalries are set aside – or created – to ensure that agendas of the noble houses are met.\\n\\nFor all the deception, manipulation and chicanery employed during the election process, it is almost unheard of for the tactics employed to escalate to violence or outright sabotage. Such actions are considered heretical, for the Phoenix King is the anointed servant of Asuryan.\\n\\nFew High Elf nobles are so consumed with victory that they could believe, even for a moment, that the Creator God would ever approve of a King selected by the ruling council under such dubious and destructive circumstances.\\n	false

He was the mightiest warrior in an age of darkness and constant strife; best loved and most accursed of all the Phoenix Kings of Ulthuan.\\n\\nAenarion’s reign began in a time of terror and strife. The polar gates, once used by the star-walking Old Ones to step from world to world, had collapsed, unleashing a roiling tide of magical energy across the world.\\n\\nIn the magic’s wake came the daemonic legions of the Chaos Gods, who sought to claim the mortal world for their own. Against a foe such as this the Elves stood no chance, for they were unschooled in warfare and their magic was used only for peaceful pursuits. Ulthuan was soon ablaze with war and slaughter, and the Elves pleaded to their gods for salvation.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_first_of_the_phoenix_kings_description	Aenarion was a wanderer who had travelled the length of the world, but who swiftly returned to Ulthuan in its time of need. Realising that the Elves could not long stand against the unfettered fury of Chaos, Aenarion battled his way through the land to the Shrine of Asuryan. There he offered himself to the sacred fire, and implored Asuryan to save his people. Asuryan made no response, but Aenarion held to his promise and cast himself into the white-hot flames – yet Aenarion did not die that day. He emerged unscathed from the fires, transformed by Asuryan’s divine will from mortal Elf to the first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings.\\n\\nAenarion began his reign with a truly auspicious victory. Outside the walls of the temple, he faced a howling Daemon horde whose black hearts were set on toppling the shrine, that the sacred fires might be forever extinguished. With a single throw of his hunting spear, Aenarion slew the Daemon-lord who led the charge. Then, scarcely breaking step, he took up the Daemon’s weapon and butchered the rest of that abominable host.\\n\\nWord of Aenarion’s victory swiftly spread across Ulthuan. All Elvenkind took heart at his actions, and rallied to him even as the Daemons reeled from the defeat. Caledor Dragontamer, the greatest wizard of the era, swore fealty to Aenarion, and together they trained the Elves in the art of battle.\\n\\nWhilst Aenarion bade the priests of Vaul forge mighty weapons of tempered ithilmar and steel, Caledor undertook the tutelage of his fellow mages, teaching them great sorceries to banish and destroy. Thus changed the Elves’ fortunes. With Aenarion at their head, the children of Ulthuan took the fight to the Daemons, casting down their champions and hurling their armies back into the Realm of Chaos.\\n\\nFor nearly a century, the war dragged on without respite or sign of victory, and the Elves began to lose heart. Moments of peace were few, and even these were tainted by the knowledge that the Daemons would soon return. Even the implacable Aenarion realised that there could be no victory – only a slow and inevitable defeat.\\n\\nUltimately, it was Caledor, that wisest and most ancient of sorcerers, who would offer salvation. He devised a plan to create a cosmic vortex that would drain magic from the world, and with it the Daemons who rode upon its fury. It was a desperate plan, with little hope of success, but Caledor, and many like him, thought a last desperate gamble would be preferable to the slow death the Elf people were enduring.\\n\\nAenarion opposed Caledor’s plan, calling it the counsel of despair. Although in his heart he knew that the war was unwinnable, the Phoenix King was determined to put off the end for as long as possible, rather than risk Caledor’s plan failing. Such was Aenarion’s charisma and powers of reason, that he surely would have changed Caledor’s mind entirely. Yet soon thereafter, Daemons overran Avelorn. Astarielle, Everqueen of Ulthuan and wife to Aenarion, was slain in the attack, and their children could not be found amongst the carnage.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_widowmaker_description	Upon hearing of his family’s fate, Aenarion was overcome with terrible fury. He swore to kill every Daemon on the face of the world and declared that he would travel to the Blighted Isle. Dread filled those who heard his words, for it could mean only one thing: Aenarion intended to draw forth the Widowmaker, a weapon of terrible power that had waited, embedded in the great black Altar of Khaine since the beginning of time.\\n\\nAs old as the world itself, it was the ultimate weapon, death itself made manifest – a splinter of the fatal weapon forged for the death god Khaine, capable of slaying mortals and gods alike. All knew that to wield Khaine’s blade was to invite death, damn your soul and doom your lineage forevermore.\\n\\nUpon learning of his liege’s intent, Caledor beseeched Aenarion to relent, but he would not be dissuaded. Ignoring all warnings from mortal and immortal alike, Aenarion vaulted onto the back of Indraugnir, the greatest of the Dragons, and set off for the Blighted Isle.\\n\\nThe journey was long and arduous and tested even Indraugnir’s might. Winged Daemons assailed Elf and Dragon as they travelled, trying to turn Aenarion from his path. The Elf gods whispered warnings in Aenarion’s ear, but if he heard, he paid no heed. Parting ways with Indraugnir just a few leagues from the Altar of Khaine, Aenarion walked towards his fate.\\n\\nIt is said that even the ghost of his departed wife pleaded with him to turn back. Yet, as he stood before the altar, Aenarion hardened his heart and wrenched free the great blood-dripping weapon, sealing his fate, and that of his people.\\n\\nWhen Aenarion returned, those Elves most embittered by the war flocked to this side, and he created a kingdom in the dismal land of Nagarythe. There, to the surprise of everyone, he took another wife, the beautiful seeress Morathi. In time, Morathi bore him a second son, whom they named Malekith.\\n\\nSoon after, the court of Aenarion earned itself a dark reputation, and the Elves of other lands were reluctant to go there. Tales of cruelty at Aenarion’s court began to spread across Ulthuan. Even Caledor led his Dragon-riders south to his own land. It is said that Caledor’s departure angered Aenarion greatly, but the Daemons struck again before his wrath could bear fruit. Such was the size and ferocity of the daemonic attack that it became obvious to all but Aenarion that the war was lost, and the world was doomed to eternal darkness.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_great_ritual_description	Caledor, fully aware of Aenarion’s incipient madness, decided that there was only one thing left he could do. He called together a convocation of the greatest High Elf sorcerers then living, and assembled them on the Isle of the Dead. With Caledor Dragontamer intent on performing the ritual, Aenarion was left with no choice. He assembled his forces and moved to defend the mages on the Isle of the Dead.\\n\\nAt the centre of Ulthuan, the two forces met. Dragons, so numerous that their wings darkened the sky, descended upon the Chaos host. Elves and Daemons were slain in their thousands, and the death agonies of monsters filled the sea with foam. As the creation of the vortex began, the seas churned, and a terrible wind blew from the north.\\n\\nThe skies darkened, and raw magic lashed the tortured earth. At the last, Aenarion, with only the faithful Indraugnir beside him, fought a bloody battle against four Greater Daemons of the Chaos Gods as they strove to breach Caledor’s wards. It was a battle no mortal could ever win, yet Aenarion’s fury and determination that day set him amongst the ranks of the gods – one by one, the foul creatures fell beneath the Sword of Khaine, though Aenarion was mortally wounded in return.\\n\\nWhile the battle raged, the High Elf sorcerers chanted the spell that would create the vortex. Chain lightning flickered. The world shuddered. For a moment all was silent. Then the mountains shivered. Terrible energies pulsed between earth and sky. From the mountaintops, bolts of pure power leapt to converge over the Isle of the Dead.\\n\\nWhile Aenarion and his outnumbered army fought, the sorcerers struggled to complete their ritual. One by one they died, the weakest succumbing first as the magic that they sought to control burned out their minds. Even as Aenarion defeated the four Daemons, the ritual was finally completed – or at least partially so. The High Elf sorcerers had succeeded in opening a vortex to drain away the raging magic, but were trapped within it, eternally keeping it open, forever held in their battle with Chaos.\\n\\nHis foes defeated, but his body ruined, Aenarion climbed wearily upon the back of the wounded Indraugnir and made once more for the Blighted Isle. Barely managing to complete the journey, Indraugnir crashed to the ground on the shores of that dismal island. Trembling from fatigue and the terrible wounds to his ancient body, Indraugnir gave one last bellow of defiance and died.\\n\\nAlone, Aenarion crawled back to the Altar of Khaine. He knew that should anyone take the weapon of Khaine, they could rule the world, and so he thrust it back into the rock from whence it came. Then, it is said, he lay down beside the ravaged and torn bulk of his beloved steed and passed from that age of the world.\\n\\nThe immediate effects of Caledor Dragontamer’s ritual were a series of magical storms, earthquakes and tidal waves that ravaged the land for three days. Thousands died as the shores of Ulthuan were swept clear by monstrous waves, ships were sunk, and the sky was split by lightning bolts. When the storms abated, though, the polar gates were sealed, and the daemonic legions were gone. Ulthuan was a land in ruins, but at least it had a future.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_seeds_of_tragedy_description	A year to the day after Aenarion disappeared, the princes of Ulthuan convened at the Shrine of Asuryan to elect a new Phoenix King. The obvious choice was Malekith, Aenarion’s son by Morathi. He had grown to be a mighty warrior, a great sorcerer and an excellent general, but there were those amongst the High Elf nobility who remembered the cruel days of Aenarion’s court in Nagarythe and they doubted that any child raised there could be entirely wholesome.\\n\\nMalekith said that he desired the kingship not for himself but in honour of the memory of his father. However, if the princes did not call upon him to serve, he would willingly swear fealty to whoever was selected. The princes thought this handsomely said, and took Malekith at his word.\\n\\nFrom their own number they chose Bel Shanaar, Prince of Tiranoc, an Elf who had distinguished himself in the war and yet was seen as a voice of peace and reason. Morathi shrieked her protests at her son not being chosen, but Malekith calmed her and agreed that the selection was a good one. He was the first to bend his knee to the future Phoenix King.\\n\\nSo began the great days of exploration. Colonies were planted across the face of the world. Contact was established with the Dwarfs and a great era of trade and friendship began. Bel Shanaar, a seaman of wondrous skill, personally visited the new colonies and even ventured to Karaz-a-Karak in the Worlds Edge Mountains to swear the Oath of Friendship with the Dwarf kings. Malekith became his ambassador there. Thus, though none could yet know it, were sown the seeds of tragedy.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_bel_shanaar_description	As the Elves spread and multiplied across the face of the world, wealth flowed back into Ulthuan. The Elven cities became places of beauty and wonder once again. And, though the folk did not realise it, Chaos returned – slowly, softly and insidiously. It came in a new guise, and so there were no defences raised against – it spread in the form of the Cults of Luxury and Pleasure.\\n\\nAs the cults’ influence spread, and their excesses deepened, the Phoenix King grew ever more concerned. Rumours abounded of living sacrifice and unwholesome association with the very darkest of forbidden gods. So it was that on his return to Ulthuan, Malekith found a realm in the grip of suspicion. The Cults of Excess were strongest in Nagarythe, his homeland, and his mother, the Lady Morathi, had long been a devotee. Indeed, legend has it that she was one of the founding members, and their High Priestess.\\n\\nMalekith appeared horrified by what he found in Nagarythe. He denounced the entire coven of pleasure worshippers, including his mother, and handed them over to the Phoenix King. Ingratiating himself further with the Phoenix King, he championed the hunt for hidden members of the cults.\\n\\nIt seemed that cultists could be found in all levels of society. Nobody was safe from his scrutiny. Military action against the cults seemed inevitable. Malekith called Ulthuan’s lords to a Council of War at the Shrine of Asuryan. On the eve of the council, the worst of horrors was revealed: Malekith claimed the Phoenix King himself was a secret member of one of the cults. Before Bel Shanaar could deny this, Malekith had him poisoned.\\n\\nWith this act, Malekith had gone too far. No one could believe that the king had been a worshipper of the cults, certainly not the assembled princes who had all known Bel Shanaar long and well. Too late, the light of suspicion fell on Malekith. He and his followers already had the Shrine of Asuryan in their possession. The princes and their bodyguards were trapped within his grasp, and a secret treaty with his kin in Nagarythe meant an army of cultists would impose Malekith’s will on the leaderless Elves.\\n\\nBelieving that all he had to do was crown himself and slay the princes to ensure his ascendance, Malekith marched into the sacred flame, confident that, like his father before him, he could endure the ordeal. He was wrong. The flame of Asuryan would not suffer his polluted body to pass through it. Thus did the flame that brought Aenarion miraculous rebirth bring nothing but ruin to his deceitful and treacherous son.\\n\\nMalekith was caught within the fire, his body terribly scarred and burned. It is said that his screams were so terrible that none who heard them could ever cast them from memory. However, Malekith’s twisted will was not yet spent. Unable to pass through the fires that even then ravaged his body, he managed to cast himself back onto the side of the platform from which he had entered.\\n\\nWith their leader on the verge of death, Malekith’s followers took up their master’s body and fled the shrine, leaving most of the Elf princes dead within and massacring all who stood in their path. An age of tragedy and conflict was about to begin.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_caledor_the_first_description	With Malekith’s betrayal, the Elf realms were plunged into turmoil once more. Malekith and his followers fled north to Nagarythe. Leaderless, the High Elves did not pursue. Frantic consultations were held between the surviving princes, the chief priest of the Shrine of Asuryan and the Captain of the Phoenix Guard. It was decided that there was only one Elf capable of the task: the third Phoenix King would be Imrik, who upon his succession took the name Caledor the First, for he was the grandson of the famous mage of that name.\\n\\nScarcely had Caledor been affirmed when the legions of Nagarythe swept down from their grim realm, bearing Malekith’s banner before them. Thus did civil war engulf Ulthuan and the colonies – a desperate conflict in which quarter was neither asked nor given. Malekith himself rode at the head of his host, a dread figure clad in armour as black as his soul – then, and ever after, he would be known as the Witch King.\\n\\nAs the war ground on, the folk of Nagarythe became ever more desperate, relying on the blackest of sorceries and daemonic pacts. Thus did they come to be known as Dark Elves. Consumed by madness, the Witch King decided on a final scheme with which he could reverse the tide of the war – he would undo the spells that held together the Great Vortex, and return Chaos to the world.\\n\\nThe daemonic legions would march once more upon the face of the world – but this time to the aid of their new allies. Shocked by the turn of events, one amongst the Witch King’s court saw this plan for the madness it was, and brought word of it to Caledor.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_sundering_description	As the Witch King and his councillors began their terrible ritual, the greatest wizards of the Elves attempted to stop them, but such was the awesome power of the Witch King’s dark magic that he and his coven of mages slowly and inexorably gained the upper hand. The heavens shook and the earth trembled. In the far north of the world, the Realm of Chaos churned and prepared to advance once more. In the camp of the Phoenix King, Caledor prayed to all the gods and to his grandsire to aid him.\\n\\nAt dusk, the Witch King and his followers began their final push. Daemonic sorcerers came to their aid, and the last spells of the defenders collapsed before their onslaught. From the sky, the triumphant laughter of the Dark Gods was heard. Then, as the tainted magic touched the Isle of the Dead at the very heart of the vortex, new players entered the game. Mighty figures clad in light sent the surge of mystical power tumbling back to Nagarythe. The trapped mages of the Isle of the Dead refused to let their work be undone.\\n\\nAs the wave of energy reached Nagarythe, the island buckled under the titanic stress. Across Ulthuan, earthquakes cast down cities and toppled mountains. A wall of water a thousand feet high smashed down on Nagarythe. The sea rushed in to cover all of the dark kingdom and most of Tiranoc besides. Thousands were slain – drowned by waves, buried by earthquakes or struck by magical lightning. The shock was felt as far away as the Worlds Edge Mountains and is recorded in the chronicles of the Dwarf kings.\\n\\nWith the High Elves weakened and in disarray, the surviving Dark Elves retreated northwards and founded the kingdom of Naggaroth in a bleak and bitter land. For a century, both sides nursed their many wounds. Soon though, there began a long period of sea warfare and skirmishing over the north of Ulthuan as the Witch King sought to gain a foothold once more. Neither side had the strength to dominate, and the Blighted Isle, where the Widowmaker still rested, changed hands several times. During this period, Caledor oversaw the building of the fortresses at Griffon Gate, Phoenix Gate, Eagle Gate, Dragon Gate and Unicorn Gate.\\n\\nCaledor personally led the last expedition to the Blighted Isle and reclaimed it from the Dark Elves. It is said that he stood before the Altar of Khaine and for a moment the Blade called to him. He stood there for a time, head bowed, and in the end, simply said no.\\n\\nReturning home from the conquest of the Blighted Isle, Caledor’s ship was separated from the rest of the High Elf fleet by a freak storm. It was attacked by Dark Elf raiders who set the ship alight. For long hours, Caledor and his crew fought off their attackers, but the Dark Elves gradually gained the upper hand, and the Phoenix King realised that he and his remaining warriors could not win.\\n\\nRather than fall into the hands of the Witch King’s servants, Caledor jumped into the sea clad in full armour. Thus passed Caledor the Conqueror. It was a bad end for a great king.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_caledor_the_second_description	Caledor the First had perished, but his legacy remained. For his successor, he left a strong army, a secure line of fortresses in the north and the most powerful navy in the world. When the Council of Princes chose Caledor’s son to succeed him, continuity was foremost in their minds – to an Elf people desperate for stability, Caledor II promised a familiar hand at the tiller. Alas, Caledor II shared few of his father’s traits. Where his father had been wise, Caledor II was foolish. Where the father had been a great general, the son was rash and impetuous.\\n\\nAs the Elves returned to the Old World in strength, trade between the two realms grew once more. Whilst rumours of the Elven civil war had reached the ears of the Dwarfs, they didn’t really understand the situation. Reaving and kinslaying were completely alien concepts to them, and no Dwarf would ever break his oath to his liege lord.\\n\\nAlas, Malekith had been shown the secret trade routes of the Dwarfs during his period as Bel Shanaar’s ambassador, and he now used that knowledge to his own benefit. Dark Elves, garbed as warriors of Ulthuan, fell upon the Dwarf caravans, seizing their goods and leaving tokens of their passage that the Dwarfs could not help but trace back to the Elves of Ulthuan.\\n\\nSuspicion fell instantly upon the High Elves, and King Gotrek demanded recompense. When word of this demand reached Caledor, his reply was immediate and undiplomatic. He sent a message saying that the Phoenix King did not answer demands but granted pleas.\\n\\nIn turn, King Gotrek sent a blunt reply saying he made pleas to neither Elf nor god and demanded twice the recompense because of the implied insult. Caledor sent the Dwarf ambassador back with his beard shaved off and said that if Gotrek wanted compensation he should come to Ulthuan and collect it.\\n\\nThus began the War of the Beard, born from the dangerous combination of honour and stiff-necked pride. Dwarf armies quickly laid siege to the trading city of Tor Alessi, and Gotrek swore an oath that he would have his money or its weregeld price in Elf blood, or else he would shave his head. It was a mighty oath. His ambassador had already become a Troll Slayer from the shame of having his beard shaved. The Dwarfs were determined that their king should not endure a similar fate.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_war_of_the_beard_description	Upon hearing of the Dwarf attack, the Phoenix King was outraged. He instantly dispatched an expedition to relieve Tor Alessi. Indeed, so mighty was the fleet, and so great was the army that it bore, that many of the Phoenix King’s advisors feared that Ulthuan had been left all but defenceless, should they suffer another attack. Caledor flew into a towering rage and dismissed their fears as groundless.\\n\\nDespite the arrival of Caledor’s great host, the war dragged on. The fortress cities of the Dwarfs were virtually impregnable. The dour, stalwart Dwarf troops were quite unlike any foe the Elves had faced before. Displaying the tenacity and stubbornness for which they have become renowned, the Dwarfs simply refused to give up or admit defeat, even when hopelessly outnumbered.\\n\\nFor their part, the Dwarfs were astonished by the power of the Elf forces. They had judged the strength of Ulthuan by that of the least of its provinces. The huge armies of knights and disciplined infantry were not what they had expected. Still, in true Dwarf fashion, they were not about to admit to a mistake, especially to an Elf.\\n\\nThe war engendered a legacy of hatred and bitterness that was to last for thousands of years. In response to the beard-shaving incident, the vengeful Dwarfs chopped down entire virgin forests simply to spite the Elves. In revenge, the Elves poisoned the tarns and underground lakes from which the Dwarfs drew their water, and a great sickness spread throughout the Worlds Edge Mountains.\\n\\nBoth sides fought till nearly their entire military strength was spent. Tired of their lack of success, Caledor II dismissed his generals and took command of the Elven host personally. It was his last great mistake – at the fourteenth siege of Tor Alessi, Caledor II was cut down by King Gotrek, who snatched the Phoenix Crown from his bloodied corpse and took it in payment for the Elves’ insolence.\\n\\nWith this final victory, the Dwarfs withdrew, claiming their honour was satisfied. Any petitions to return the Phoenix Crown were greeted with an invitation to come and plead for it. The first Phoenix Crown remains in the great vault of the Everpeak to the present day, an enduring source of festering hatred and recrimination between the two peoples.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_fate_of_the_colonies_description	With the death of Caledor II, the Elves once again found themselves in the middle of a war without a Phoenix King. Yet worse was to come. Even as the Elves mustered a suicidal expedition to besiege Karaz-a-Karak, the world’s most unassailable fortress, word came that the Dark Elves had invaded Ulthuan once more. The Witch King’s long plan, in which both Caledor and Gotrek had unwittingly played their parts, had come to fruition.\\n\\nSailing under a pall of dark sorcery, the fleets of the Witch King seized the Blighted Isle and retook most of the Shadowlands. Several Black Arks – enchanted islands torn from sundered Nagarythe – were beached to form the core of a new fortress city at the harbour of Anlec. From there, the Dark Elves drove south to besiege the Griffon Gate.\\n\\nTo compound matters further, the tang of the Witch King’s sorceries spread far and wide across Ulthuan, luring all manner of vile beasts from their lairs amidst the Annulii Mountains. Whilst the northern kingdoms bore the brunt of the fighting against the oncoming Dark Elves, only the most fortunate of princedoms were spared predations from Harpies, Chimerae and worse.\\n\\nThe High Elves were caught in the jaws of a trap, fighting a war on two fronts against two powerful foes. The Fourth Council met at the Shrine of Asuryan and chose Caradryel of Yvresse, who was as different from Caledor II as night from day. He was quiet and unassuming, an indifferent soldier but an able ruler. Caradryel’s first decree was that the colonies would be abandoned, and their peoples brought home to Ulthuan.\\n\\nFaced with the implacable hostility of the Dwarfs, it seemed to him foolish to maintain huge armies overseas, particularly with a more pressing threat to the Elf heartland. Caradryel knew that it would be many long ages of the world before the Dwarfs would consent to reconciliation without demanding ruinous recompense, but he also knew that there could be no war if the Dwarfs no longer had anyone to fight. Thus did Caradryel abandon pride. He ordered the forging of a new Phoenix Crown and called the armies home.\\n\\nAmong the haughtiest Elves there was a huge outcry. It seemed a gross insult to Elf pride that the Phoenix Crown should remain in Dwarf hands. Caradryel, ever a plainspoken individual, replied that he would rather lose the crown than the realm, and thereafter ignored the complaints.\\n\\nAdditionally, there were protests from the Elf colonists, who saw the departure of the armies as a betrayal. Once more, Caradryel was unassailable in his intent, and direct in his rebuttal. He said simply that, if Elves required the protection of the armies of Ulthuan, then they should return home, where those armies could best offer that protection.\\n\\nMany Elves did return but others, such as those in Athel Loren, refused to abandon their adopted homeland and declared themselves independent of the Phoenix Throne. Thus isolated from their kin, their culture thereafter took a different path from that practised on Ulthuan, in some ways staying truer to Elven tradition, and in others departing far from it. Though saddened by this turn of events, Caradryel attempted no forcible repatriation – Ulthuan’s situation was tenuous enough without risking another civil war.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_caradryel_description	Caradryel now turned his gaze to matters of war. Recognising his own inexperience as a general, he appointed a succession of brilliant field commanders to lead the High Elf armies. Tethlis of Caledor, in particular, established a brilliant reputation, lifting the siege of Griffon Gate and harrying the Dark Elves to within sight of Anlec.\\n\\nWith his wars thus governed by veteran hands, Caradryel continued to oversee the long retreat from overseas. As ever more troops returned, he strengthened the forces holding the great gateway fortresses. He also initiated the system of rotating units to the forts in succession, so that the forces holding these valuable citadels would always be fresh and near to full strength.\\n\\nFor the rest of Caradryel’s reign, sporadic war blazed through northern Ulthuan. Ever more Dark Elves flowed in from Naggaroth, their blades lent purpose by centuries of nurtured hate. Yet all their twisted malice could not overcome the disciplined and impeccably trained armies of the Phoenix King, many of whom were veterans of the wars with the Dwarfs.\\n\\nThe northern seas were the scene of many great naval battles, and despite an increased program of shipbuilding, the High Elves were never entirely able to sweep the seas clear of their foes. Caradryel was the first Phoenix King to die peacefully in bed.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_tethlis_description	The Fifth Council chose Tethlis of Caledor, the hero of Griffon Gate, to be Caradryel’s successor. Tethlis had learned well the value of preparation and organisation from Caradryel, and he came to the throne with one aim: to force the Dark Elves out of Ulthuan and reclaim the Blighted Isle from the spawn of Naggaroth. He followed this plan through with single-minded ruthlessness and determination.\\n\\nTethlis’ heart was filled with a terrible, cold hatred for the children of Naggaroth, for they had slain his family in one of their many raids. Thus did the Dark Elves forge their most implacable of enemies. Tethlis fought not for honour or glory. He sought only to end the threat of Naggaroth for all time, and he might have succeeded had it not been for the decline in power of the Dragons.\\n\\nDuring the latter part of Caradryel’s reign, the Dragons had become increasingly rare. For reasons unknown, many had started to drift into longer and longer sleeps, waking perhaps once per century. The Elves needed to increase their strength in other areas to compensate for losing the raw power and savage strength of the great beasts.\\n\\nThe first years of Tethlis’ reign saw the assembling of new armies. Every Elf city was required to have a martial field where its soldiers could train and fight mock battles. Painstakingly, with meticulous attention to detail, Tethlis rebuilt the Elf forces to a strength not seen since the time of Aenarion. He never committed an army to the field without being sure that he could bring overwhelming force to bear and never fought a battle without being sure he could win it.\\n\\nBy relentless attrition he wore the Dark Elves down. Over the long centuries, a series of massive offensives rolled them back through the Shadowlands and eventually culminated in the storming of Anlec. Tethlis was cold and ruthless, even by the standards of Elves. He ordered the entire city razed. No prisoners were taken. Salt was strewn in the fields. Shocked though his subjects were, they obeyed. No Dark Elf was left alive on Ulthuan.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_battle_of_the_waves_description	Having scoured Ulthuan, Tethlis turned his attention to the Blighted Isle, which was still in the hands of the Witch King’s legions. The largest Elf armada of all time was assembled to reclaim it. Hundreds of ships bore many thousands of troops out to sea. Elf mages bound the weather and kept the skies clear of storms. The seas were swept clear of Naggarothi ships. On the shores of the Blighted Isle, the Dark Elf host assembled, determined to deny the High Elves a foothold on the shore.\\n\\nThe Elves landed and thus began the Battle of the Waves, in which the swirling tides turned red with blood. Both sides fought with abandon, crimson water swirling round their knees. The skies were black with arrows and crossbow bolts, and the wounded were trampled and drowned in the shallow waves. Inch by bloody inch, the High Elves fought their way onto the beach and overran the island, driving their dark kinsfolk into the sea.\\n\\nThe carnage was ghastly. Dark Elves were butchered by the thousand until even the hardiest Elf captains were sickened. They feared that their troops might acquire a taste for such butchery and become no better than those they fought against. With a great victory won, Tethlis at first insisted that the army push on to Naggaroth, but as the army moved northward he found himself drawn, by some irresistible influence, to the Altar of Khaine.\\n\\nOn his journey through the Plain of Bones, Tethlis saw something glitter. Strangely drawn to the light, he unearthed the Dragon Armour of Aenarion. Of Aenarion or Indraugnir, there was no other trace to be found. The armour, he gifted to Auaralion, the great grandson of Morelion, Aenarion’s son by Astarielle. This was virtually his last act as Phoenix King.\\n\\nThere are two versions of what happened when Tethlis at last came before the Widowmaker. Some records say that he dismissed the White Lions and the rest of his retinue, claiming that he wanted a moment alone to contemplate the blade that had done his people so much harm. It is said that a Dark Elf assassin emerged from his hiding place beneath the piles of bones and struck Tethlis down with a poisoned blade.\\n\\nOthers say that Tethlis, determined to end the war with the Dark Elves, grasped the Sword of Khaine and that it writhed in his grip and started to come free, and that the king was cut down by his own bodyguard, who feared the consequences of Aenarion’s fatal weapon being unleashed once more upon the world.\\n\\nNo one knows for sure exactly what happened. Scholars are divided. All that is known is that Tethlis died that day, and, lacking his driving presence, the armada turned back from Naggaroth.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_bel_korhadris_subtitle	The Reign of Bel-Korhadris	false
gen_lore_hef_reign_of_bel_korhadris_description	With their people weary of war, the Elves of the Sixth Council selected Bel-Korhadris of Saphery to be the next Phoenix King. Bel-Korhadris was a wizard prince and a famed scholar. While he did not neglect the defence of the realm, he was not given to fighting, believing that magic could shield Ulthuan from its enemies.\\n\\nBel-Korhadris ruled wisely and well and was loved by all. His reign was notable for being a time of near unbroken peace. The Dark Elves of Naggaroth had been so weakened by Tethlis’ onslaught that they were afraid to attempt more than raids, which were seldom more than simple – if unutterably cruel – acts of piracy and brigandage.\\n\\nIt was well  for the High Elves that their ancient enemies lay quiet, for Tethlis’ war had left much of Ulthuan in ruins, with untold villages and cities caught between the armies of light and dark. Worse, the war’s constant demand for fresh warriors had left the foothills of the Annulii Mountains unguarded against the monsters of the peaks.\\n\\nAs a result, many areas of Ulthuan that had suffered little from the ravages of war were preyed upon by Manticores and other fell creatures. Bel-Korhadris’ first act as Phoenix King was, therefore, to decree an age of rebirth – the ruined lands would be reclaimed, shattered settlements rebuilt, monsters driven out and the glory of Ulthuan restored once more.\\n\\nThus began a reign that would be forever remembered as the start of a second golden age. During this time, the White Tower of Hoeth was constructed. This was to be Bel-Korhadris’ greatest contribution to the rebirth of Ulthuan: a citadel of sorcery and scholarship, where the wisdom of the corners of the world would be gathered, and grimoires of the most potent spells would be enshrined.\\n\\nFor a thousand years, the Elves raised this vast sky-reaching structure, harnessing secrets of artificer and mage in equal measure with every stone that was laid. Craftsmen laboured for nearly a millennium on intricate carvings. The tower was woven round with spells of illusion and warding to protect this treasured knowledge.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_second_golden_age_subtitle	A Second Golden Age	false
gen_lore_hef_second_golden_age_description	As work on the White Tower progressed, Bel-Korhadris founded the Order of Loremasters who would be both the guardians and pupils of the knowledge assembled within. Every discipline, from warfare and sorcery to alchemy and astromancy, was to be studied. Many famed scholars and sorcerers gathered at Hoeth, and such an exchange of knowledge occurred as had not been seen before, and has not been seen since.\\n\\nIn the shadow of the needle-pointed spire, thousands of the wisest philosophers debated their knowledge. Within the library, a cadre of Loremasters began to inscribe the Book of Days, the great history of the Elf people on which all future histories would be based. It was during this time that the Swordmasters of Hoeth gathered to study the art of swordsmanship and protect the tower.\\n\\nThough Bel-Korhadris’ own passion was the pursuit of knowledge, he recognised that scholarship and magic alone would not see Ulthuan preserved – he knew that the time would again come when the High Elves would need heroes of the blade. He therefore encouraged the nobles of his court to prove their personal valour in vanquishing the beasts that roamed the land.\\n\\nThus was Bel-Korhadris’ reign also a renaissance of personal glory not seen in Ulthuan since the times before Aenarion, so vigorously did nobles of all ranks embrace the Phoenix King’s charge. Slowly but surely, the kingdoms of Ulthuan were scoured with fire and sword, the roaming monsters slain or else driven back into the Annulii Mountains to lick grievous wounds.\\n\\nThe threat of such creatures could never truly be ended, however. Even should an army prove bold enough to scour the Annulii Mountains, it could spend a thousand lifetimes amongst their peaks, and still not find every lair, nest and roost. Each time the watch on the mountains grew lax, vile creatures slithered and crawled into Ulthuan’s heartlands once more. Yet Bel-Korhadris did not seek lasting victory against the creatures of the mountains – he desired only that his lands be reclaimed, and that the battle-skill of Ulthuan’s nobility was not dulled by the years of relative peace.\\n\\nBel-Korhadris died just after the completion of the White Tower and was buried amid its foundations. It is said that his ghost still haunts the crypts below the tower and occasionally assists scholars in their searches.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_aethis_subtitle	The Reign of Aethis	false
gen_lore_hef_reign_of_aethis_description	Bel-Korhadris was succeeded by Aethis of Saphery. He was the first Phoenix King who did not inherit an unstable kingdom or take the throne in the aftermath of a war. In his reign, the long peace continued. The Dark Elves lay quiescent in Naggaroth. Their raids ceased. Many suspected that they were a dying race, slowly passing into extinction. Rumours abounded that the Witch King had finally died.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs, too, were content to be left alone. During the early centuries of Aethis’ rule, news of the founding of a new human empire reached Ulthuan, but this seemed no great cause for concern. Nothing threatened the High Elves. Strangely enough, this was also the period when the High Elves came to realise they were a dying race. Even during the long golden days of peace, the population had fallen. The number of births had simply decreased, and the great cities began to empty.\\n\\nAethis was a noted poet and singer. He gathered all the great artists of Ulthuan to his court in Saphery. Dramatists, painters, sculptors, writers of histories and masques all found a place in his palace of carved jade. This was the high-water mark of Elf culture, when most of their greatest works of art were created.\\n\\nThis was the period that saw the creation plays of Tazelle, and Torion Fireheart’s animated court portraits. An army of sculptors and artisans beautified the mountains of Chrace. Above the Griffon Gate, a towering Griffon five hundred feet high seemed to leap from the mountain. So cunning was the sculptor’s work that the story was told that it would come alive to guard the pass against any invader.\\n\\nProdigious amounts of wealth were spent on grandiose projects such as these. The city of Lothern grew from a small fishing village to a great city to accommodate the increase in trade from the colonies and other realms. Contact was made with the old human empire in Cathay. Representatives of the Phoenix King arrived at the court of the Dragon Emperor in Wei-Jin. Silk, jade and spices became valued commodities in Ulthuan.\\n\\nSecure in their strength, the Elves began to run down their armies and fleets. After nearly fifteen hundred years of relative peace under Bel-Korhadris and Aethis, memories of old wars and old enmities began to fade. Approaches were made to the Dwarfs about the return of the Phoenix Crown. These were rebuffed, but the Elves took no insult.\\n\\nA certain complacency set in. Many nobles cast aside their martial pursuits and traditions, thinking such brutal arts an ill fit for these civilised times. Factions sprang up at court, and intrigue – always a dangerous pastime among the Elves – became a way of life for many. Where only a handful of generations earlier a prince would have proved his worth with sword or wisdom, now he did so by delivering prettily spoken compliments and razor-sharp epigrams.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_all_good_things_description	Not all in Ulthuan surrendered entirely to indolence of Aethis’ reign, however. In the north, Prince Valedor of Ellyrion ensured that the watch on the great gates never faltered, and that the warriors there received the best training and the finest wargear that Ulthuan could provide.\\n\\nOn one occasion, Valedor happened upon several nobles of the Phoenix King’s court as they were about the business of emptying one of the Griffon Gate’s armouries. Scores of wagons were already loaded with fine-wrought ithilmar scale and Dragon plate when Valedor encountered them.\\n\\nFlush with royal authority, the nobles spoke boldly at first, informing Valedor that the Phoenix King wished the ‘surplus’ to be used as costume at his latest theatrical masterpiece. Valedor flew into a rage and struck down the speaker with a single blow of his mailed fist, at which point the nobles – craven and pleasure-loving wretches to an Elf – fled, leaving Valedor’s warriors to return the armour to its proper place.\\n\\nIt later transpired that Aethis had given no such instruction: the nobles had acted on their own initiative in order to gain their king’s favour. None of this would preserve Prince Valedor, however. Little by little, his name and reputation were whittled apart by those he had thwarted. Within a year, he had been stripped of all honour and title, and his family divested of their ancestral wealth.\\n\\nOnce more, the Cult of Luxury began to spread, this time cloaked in a secrecy that made it even more attractive to jaded Elf aristocrats. After a while, the Swordmasters of Hoeth began to investigate the cult and report back to the White Tower. Their findings disturbed the High Loremaster sufficiently for him to take them to the Phoenix King.\\n\\nThe Chancellor of the Court was revealed as a secret spy for Naggaroth. As he was unmasked, he drove a poisoned dagger through Aethis’ heart, and so the eighth Phoenix King was slain by a trusted friend.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_morvael_subtitle	The Reign of Morvael	false
gen_lore_hef_reign_of_morvael_description	The Eighth Council chose Morvael of Yvresse to succeed the assassinated Phoenix King. He was the High Loremaster of the White Tower under Aethis. Although learned, Morvael had little real experience of statecraft or warfare. His first act after his coronation was to order a punitive attack on Naggaroth. An Elf fleet was despatched to the cold north and was massacred by the Dark Elves.\\n\\nAs the few survivors brought word of the defeat back to Ulthuan, panic spread among the High Elves. The last thing they had expected was defeat. They had supposed the threat of Naggaroth all but extinguished, but now it seemed that the Dark Elves had merely been rebuilding their strength.\\n\\nBy allowing their fleets and armies to be run down under Bel-Korhadris and Aethis, the Elves of Ulthuan had allowed their dark kindred to catch up and perhaps even surpass them in military might. A mighty Dark Elf armada seized the Blighted Isle and sailed on to Ulthuan. They retook the cursed city of Anlec and cast up a great fortress in the rubble. Swiftly, they pushed south and were stopped only after desperate fighting around the Griffon Gate.\\n\\nDesperate for soldiers, Morvael organised the system of troop levies that still exists in Ulthuan today. This required every Elf to spend at least part of the year as part of a military force, and to provide wargear for himself. Thus was the depleted population of Ulthuan able to field mighty armies of citizen-soldiers well beyond that which it could otherwise have mustered. Morvael, having been forcibly confronted by his mediocre skills as a general over the course of earlier defeats, appointed Mentheus of Caledor as field commander.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_heavy_lies_the_crown_subtitle	Heavy Lies The Crown	false
gen_lore_hef_heavy_lies_the_crown_description	Morvael was a sensitive and highly-strung soul, often troubled by terrible nightmares and dreams. He did not care for sending his friends and subjects to their deaths, but in order to preserve the realm, there was little else he could do. He emptied the coffers of the Phoenix Throne to build a new and powerful fleet capable of carrying the war to the northern seas and stopping the flow of reinforcements from Naggaroth.\\n\\nHe was forced to use the Swordmasters of Hoeth and other agents to seek out the devotees of the Cult of Pleasure – who, as before, provided the Dark Elves with a network of influential spies – and it was his unpleasant task to sign the many death warrants that resulted. Many long nights Morvael would brood in his tower, and before long, he was turned stoop-shouldered and prematurely old by the weight of his crown.\\n\\nYet no matter how deep Morvael’s despair grew, it never overcame his sense of duty. He relied ever more upon his closest advisors and drew fresh strength from their own faith to replenish his own frail resolve. Mentheus of Caledor ever remained his closest confidant, and Morvael soon came to rely on his general’s counsel and friendship as surely as he depended upon his leadership and skill in battle.\\n\\nFor over a century, intermittent warfare blazed. The fleets of Ulthuan ranged the seas destroying Dark Elf slaving ships. Two new fortresses were built far from Ulthuan to enable these long range missions to be accomplished. At the tip of the Dark Continent, the Fortress of Dawn was built to refit the fleets and protect the trade routes to Cathay. At the tip of Lustria, the Citadel of Dusk was completed, as a base from which the Elf fleets could guard the coasts of southern Lustria.\\n\\nEventually the war reached its climax. Mentheus of Caledor besieged Anlec with a great army of Elves. Morvael remained in the Shrine of Asuryan awaiting the outcome of the battle. Every night he was assailed by ever more dreadful dreams, which some say were sent by the Witch King to plague him. With every day that passed, he became ever more despairing and hopeless as messengers brought him reports that made much of the army’s casualties and little of its chances of victory.\\n\\nYet despite Morvael’s fears, the forces of Ulthuan ultimately proved victorious. Alas, the High Elves would yet have to bear two further tragedies in the face of triumph. On the final day when Anlec fell, Mentheus was killed as he led the assault. His great Dragon, Nightfang, went berserk with rage and grief, slaughtering many Dark Elves and their monstrous thralls.\\n\\nNews of Mentheus’ death finally shattered Morvael’s resolve. Weary unto death, listless and depressed, the Phoenix King abdicated by walking into the sacred flame of Asuryan. No mortal frame could twice endure such a trial. From midnight until noon the next day, Morvael’s body burned upon the sacred pyre; as the sun reached its apex, a cold wind from the north gathered up his ashes and scattered them across the Inner Sea.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_bel_hathor_subtitle	The Reign of Bel-Hathor	false
gen_lore_hef_reign_of_bel_hathor_description	The Ninth Council ended in deadlock, a tie between the faction that wanted a warlike king and those who preferred a peacemaker. In the end, a compromise was reached and Bel-Hathor, a wizard prince of Saphery, was chosen and crowned.\\n\\nBel-Hathor seemed an inauspicious choice; like most Sapherian princes he was something of an eccentric. Many of the other princes saw him as easily manipulable towards their faction’s ends. They were wrong. Bel-Hathor turned out to be surprisingly strong-willed – through sheer personality he managed to quell much of the infighting that had plagued the Phoenix King’s court since the time of Aethis.\\n\\nHe refused all attempts to force him to order an invasion of Naggaroth. He knew that, although Ulthuan could probably win such a war, the cost would be too high. Elven numbers had so declined that many of the cities were half-empty and many of the lands abandoned. He was not prepared to gamble the future of the Elven race against the possibility of vengeance.\\n\\nSoon his attention was focused elsewhere. In two short millennia, the race of Man had risen from savagery to being the dominant race in the lands east of Ulthuan. Norse longship raids – which had long been dismissed as trivial irritants – grew to such frequency and fury that the High Elf navy could no longer contain their threat.\\n\\nRealising that the attacks would only become worse over time, Bel-Hathor called a convocation of all the greatest mages and instructed them to guard Ulthuan’s eastern approaches. After three decades of preparation, the magicians enshrouded the island’s approaches in a maze of spells, illusions and treacherous shifting shoals and mists. It became virtually impossible for Norsca raiders to reach Ulthuan except by pure chance. Legends of these terrible sea routes reached the Old World and caused Men to talk of the Elf-realm with dread.\\n\\nThe Norse were not the only Men to dare the sea routes to Ulthuan. Increasingly, other naval powers, and particularly the Empire and Bretonnia, also sent ships west over the ocean, seeking Ulthuan and the legendary golden cities of Lustria. Some of these determined mariners, and eventually some of their ships, found a route to Ulthuan. The Phoenix King issued an edict forbidding them to set foot on Elven soil. He did however agree to let Finubar, Prince of Eataine, take ship with them, to learn more of these emergent realms.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_the_seafarer_description	Finubar sailed to L’Anguille in Bretonnia and, from there, spent fifty years wandering over the continent. Because of the ancient feud with the Dwarfs, it had been a long time since any High Elf had set foot on the shores of the eastern continent. He was at once impressed and appalled at what he saw.\\n\\nThe human realms were endless, teeming and populous. Finubar had expected mud huts, primitive savages and anarchy unbound. Instead he found mighty walled cities and disciplined armies, capable of fending off the Orcs and keeping the peace over huge stretches of territory.\\n\\nHe saw that the humans were numerous and becoming more so, and that it was only a matter of time before they would eclipse even the elder races. In addition, Finubar was fascinated by the humans’ crude vitality and exuberant culture, their energy and greed. He swiftly decided that it would be better for the Elves to have these people as allies rather than enemies.\\n\\nIn his travels he also came upon the lost Elf realm of Athel Loren. He was both shocked and amazed by what he found there. The Elves of the old frontier province had taken a far different path from the High Elves; they had become one with their woodland home, as far removed from the High Elves of Ulthuan as were the Dark Elves of Naggaroth. Ever after, they were known to their kin on Ulthuan as the Wood Elves. Though the Elves of Athel Loren were not unfriendly to Finubar, further rapprochement proved impossible, and any ambassadors despatched from Ulthuan were treated with indifference at best.\\n\\nWhen Finubar finally returned to Ulthuan, he was hailed as a great hero. The Phoenix King listened to Finubar’s report and reversed his earlier edict denying the Men of the Old World access to Ulthuan. At Finubar’s request, the city of Lothern was opened to human merchants, and Elf pilots were provided to guide the trading fleets through the veiled approaches. Those races of Men who were inclined towards seamanship wasted no time in travelling to the island-continent of Ulthuan to see its wonders for themselves.\\n\\nThus began a second period of explosive growth in Lothern. Finubar watched his home city become the largest trading port in the world and was happy. The humans were astounded by the grace and majesty of Elf civilisation and well-pleased with the commerce that went on there. The Elves were content to have powerful allies in the Old World. When Bel-Hathor died peacefully of old age, Finubar was his chosen successor.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_reign_of_finubar_description	With the invaluable experience gained during his sojourn to the Old World, Finubar of Lothern was the prince best suited to understanding this new age. By temperament and experience he was ready to deal with the race of Men, and as a native of Lothern, he had grown up with an understanding of the worth of trade and a tolerant, cosmopolitan outlook on the world. In accordance with Bel-Hathor’s wishes, the ruling council elected Finubar. Thus, Finubar is the first Phoenix King to be chosen by his predecessor.\\n\\nA few amongst the ruling council were displeased with this appointment: perhaps they thought such a succession a break with all tradition. More likely, their sentiments were born of jealousy. Finubar’s actions did little to end such concerns. From the start, he was often content to leave the day to day affairs of his realm to the trusted members of his court.\\n\\nIndeed, in the early years of his reign, it seemed he was but an infrequent visitor to his own realm, for he spent much time travelling the world. Finubar’s rivals spread rumour in his absence, their eyes ever on claiming the Phoenix Throne they were once denied.\\n\\nIn the end, rebellious tongues were only stilled when the Everqueen, Alarielle, arrived unannounced at a meeting of the ruling council. Standing before the Phoenix Throne, she fixed her piercing gaze on each of the council in turn, and in icy tones reminded the princes where their loyalties truly lay. Thereafter, criticisms of Finubar’s rule were decidedly muted.\\n\\nAs the years passed, Finubar’s voyages became more sporadic, though none could say whether his wanderlust was finally leaving him, or he had simply found whatever it was he searched for. Increasingly, Finubar split his time between the business of rule and taking counsel with Belannaer, one of the oldest and wisest Loremasters of Hoeth.\\n	false

gen_lore_hef_a_new_age_description	In the one hundred and thirty eighth year of Finubar’s reign, the Great Chaos Incursion began, and it looked as if the Dark Powers had returned once more to claim the world. The Witch King himself returned at the head of a mighty host and swept the defenders of Ulthuan before him. War raged across all Ulthuan’s kingdoms. Avelorn burned, and for a time, it seemed as if the Everqueen was lost amongst the carnage, and the realm with her. Then, two mighty heroes, the twin brothers Tyrion and Teclis, arose to secure the realm and repel the invasion.\\n\\nBy the efforts of the extraordinary twins, the Dark Elves were driven off and Ulthuan was rescued from the brink of destruction. Finubar was greatly pleased by the twins’ deeds, and brought them ever closer into his councils – the Phoenix King deemed that the last war had been merely the opening skirmish in a new age of destruction, and was determined to command the loyalty of Ulthuan’s mightiest heroes. In the years that followed, other heroes would join Tyrion and Teclis at Finubar’s side, some of whom would go on to become as famous any of Phoenix Kings.\\n\\nSince then, the world has grown darker. Despite the series of magical wards raised around the island in the reign of Bel-Korhadris, Norse raids on Ulthuan have become ever more numerous. A horde of Goblins led by Grom the Paunch of Misty Mountain even managed to pillage eastern Ulthuan. Dark Elf raiders have continued to commit innumerable acts of piracy. The promise of a new golden age of peace has faded, and the Elves and their new allies have looked once more to their weapons.\\n\\nFor the Elves, the present holds both the promise of renewal and the threat of destruction. Their old enemies have grown stronger, while they in turn have become weaker. Ulthuan can still muster the mightiest fleet in the known world and its armies are rightly feared by its foes, and yet the High Elves are a shadow of their former glory. Indeed, many on Ulthuan feel the greatest days of the Elves have passed.\\n\\nYet every year brings new opportunities to win glory and fight against evil. There are still mighty Elf heroes, courageous warriors and mages willing to stand against the Dark Powers, and the mighty Dragons, though few in number, are turning restless in their long sleep.\\n\\nIn the north, the Witch King stirs once more and the Widowmaker haunts the dreams of warriors, singing songs of forbidden glory to their desperate souls. Though they have dwindled and are weary, the High Elves still have a great part to play in the world before the final act of their long drama is played out.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_eternity_chamber_description	When a Slann Mage-Priest determines to enter the very deepest of trances and to send his spirit soaring to the furthest reaches of space and time, he retires to the Eternity Chamber. Here, he seeks to attune his mind to the will of the Old Ones, to follow the strands of their consciousness, to hear even the faintest echoes of their thoughts.\\n\\nThe Great Pyramid of every temple-city contains such a chamber: as do a number of the smaller temple structures aligned upon it. While the temple’s Star Chamber is located at the pyramid’s apex, so that the Slann might contemplate the stars above and the lofty thoughts of his fellows, the Eternity Chamber lies at the very heart of the mighty temple, beneath dozens, even hundreds of metres of rock. The thoughts of the temple-city’s population are quietened, allowing the Slann Mage-Priest the peace he needs to gradually slow his metabolism, so that his heart eventually beats but once an hour.\\n\\nOnly when he has entered such a state can the Mage-Priest’s spirit detach from his body, and soar free through the dimensions. Only then can the Slann hope to detect the distant, half-heard echoes of the voices of the Old Ones.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_coming_old_ones_description	The origin of the Lizardmen is a tale that goes back to a primeval era when the world was dark and largely encased by thick sheets of ice. Long before Chaos came to the world, in a time before Elves, Dwarfs or Men, the land was ruled by titanic monsters. These enormous creatures battled for dominance and the warmest regions, those nearest the equatorial band, became the most highly contested zones.\\n\\nSome of these life forms were unthinking creatures of pure instinct, others were established civilizations that rose and fell in that forgotten age. Of that time of eternal twilight there is little knowledge, although buried ruins and descendant creatures still remain.\\n\\nInto this brutal age came a mysterious race of god-like beings that plied the heavens in silvered ships. These strangers, known as the Old Ones, came from beyond the stars where they ruled an empire that spanned not just the cosmos, but time itself. Their technology was advanced beyond imagination – to them, astrology and astronomy, science and magic were all one and the same.\\n\\nEach world in the Old Ones’ empire was linked by a gateway. Some were small portals, allowing an individual to travel inconceivable distances with but a single step. Others, often situated in the cold void of space, were portals so large that vessels the size of moons could pass through. In their travels across the endless expanse of the universe, one planet caught their eye, for they saw in it a unique and boundless potential.\\n\\nThe Old Ones decreed that this world would have a central place in their unknowable plans and stellar gates at either pole were created to allow easy access to this hopeful new colony. Before the designs for their newest planet could be fully set in motion, the Old Ones had to reshape it to better fit their needs.\\n\\nUsing powers beyond mortal comprehension, they shifted the planet’s orbit towards the warming sun. In time, the ice sheets retreated, verdant forests soon growing to cover over the newly revealed land.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_children_of_gods_description	After arriving from the heavens, the Old Ones created servants to tend to their needs. Thus began the first spawning of the Slann Mage-Priests. They were the grand viziers, trusted creatures of prodigious intellect, and the only beings able to withstand direct contact with the near-omnipotent Old Ones and comprehend their teachings.\\n\\nIt was the Slann who were to guide the lesser races whose creation would soon follow. For upon the world, the Old Ones had encountered many primitive creatures, including those that would one day be transformed into the first Elves, Dwarfs and Men. Powerful and far-sighted, the Old Ones could shape new life forms even from these imperfect materials.\\n\\nThey did encounter some creatures whose existence was incompatible with their future plans. As the climate warmed, the Saurus were created to destroy these anomalies and soon vast armies marched to war – a fight to eradicate those native races that needed to be removed.\\n\\nThe Old Ones frequently used the polar gateways to travel the cosmos, but in the meantime they created further spawnings of Slann to execute their plans. While the Saurus brought order to the world with their brutal campaigns of destruction, greater projects were undertaken.\\n\\nBy command of the Old Ones, the Slann established the rainforest temple-cities in the region that would one day become Lustria. The Skinks were the technicians and the overseers; it was their role to direct the beasts of burden to haul and heft the heavy loads. In this manner, the Lizardmen built fabulous structures that rose high above the steaming jungles.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_looming_catastrophe_description	Despite the Old Ones’ presence, all was not well with the world. Distressing signs began to manifest outside the gateways at the planet’s poles. They were but portals to another dimension, and it was from there that trouble arose. In the swirling madness of that otherworldly realm, nascent beings stirred, malign intelligences that resented the Old Ones’ trespasses.\\n\\nThe Old Ones were beings of order and near-omnipotence, but it is unknown when they first detected the impending disaster, or if they realised its magnitude. Although they tapped into the energies of the realm beyond their portals, they had always struggled to contain that power – and soon found themselves embattled by the forces of that impossible dimension. Having glimpsed some future portent, it is probable that the races the Old Ones created were intended to fight against the creatures from the Realm of Chaos.\\n\\nAfter the Lizardmen, the first of the newly created races was the Elves, and they learned the lore of magic in the lap of the gods themselves. The Dwarfs soon followed, although their magic was insular and intrinsic to their craftsmanship. As the pressures of their cosmic war intensified, the Old Ones created the prolific and adaptable race of Man, and, seemingly in haste, finally the Halflings and the Ogres were risen up from the lesser things that roamed the world.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_coming_of_chaos_description	Disaster came suddenly. Whether due to enemy attacks or structural failure, the Old Ones’ celestial portals collapsed. The eldritch machineries of the gates crashed down upon the world in a burning hail of star-metal. Simultaneously, the poles of the world imploded, opening rifts into the beyond.\\n\\nChaos spewed forth from the spirit realm. Meteors of congealed magic, a substance known as warpstone, left weirdling contrails that set the skies aflame. The planet shuddered under thunderous impacts, with some meteorites burrowing like animals, gnawing deep into the world’s foundation.\\n\\nA layer of warpstone dust was cast into the air, its mutating properties causing untold atrocities. Across the globe, the seas churned and the forest canopies shook, convulsing with grotesque growth. Where the northern gateway had once been, there now throbbed a second moon, a green satellite made of pure warpstone. Many cries were lifted to that sickly orb, as hideously twisted creatures were born, howling in their agony.\\n\\nAs their portals collapsed, the Old Ones disappeared, their fate unknown. Yet the disaster could have been worse, if the Old Ones’ most powerful servants, the Slann, had not staved off complete destruction by sealing much of the rent in reality. So great was the strain of that undertaking that half of their number were slain – their brains melted by the incongruity of Chaos.\\n\\nDespite their sacrifice, the Slann could only shrink the gap; they could neither close it nor stem the tide of magical energy that swept the planet. The Old Ones were gone, and the Lizardmen and the fledgling races were now abandoned before a new and diabolical foe.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_the_world_besieged_description	In the wake of the clouds of magic came the daemonic legions of the Chaos Gods. They crystallised out of the swirling madness, materialising in numbers beyond count. Each Daemon was a powerful facet of its master, an unnatural being that burned with the urge to destroy. And so the war for the mortal realm was begun.\\n\\nFaced with annihilation, the remaining Slann rallied, mustering armies the sizes of which have never been seen in the world since. The Daemons attacked everywhere, but the Lizardmen bore the brunt of the attack. What followed was a series of terrible wars, titanic clashes that spanned continents, lasted centuries and claimed untold lives.\\n\\nThe Saurus met the daemonic tide, able to match their ferocity and return it in kind, but the might of the Lizardmen did not rest solely with its armies. The Slann, atop their pyramid-temples, gathered the rampant magical energies to fuel spells of unprecedented destruction. They gulped in the magic-infused air and belched forth firestorms, unleashed tidal waves, or split the earth asunder to lay waste to the invaders.\\n\\nIn the war’s opening stages, the Slann proved more powerful than even the most magically adept of the Daemons. However, as the Chaos energies and unending reinforcements continued to flood into the world, the balance began to shift.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_crumbling_civilisation_description	As the Chaos energies ebbed stronger, the Slann felt their powers dim, their spells growing harder to control. Even a minute error while manipulating magical forces resulted in horrific mishap – many Slann suffered mind-shredding backlashes or were lost to their own incandescent miscues. While the unconstrained Winds of Magic sapped the Slann, it conversely invigorated the Daemons, for they were born of the unnatural stuff and could readily shape it for their own use. As the magical supremacy shifted, so too did the war.\\n\\nOn the battlefields, titans made of pure fury smashed into the Saurus cohorts until the land was awash with blood. Plague monsters and beasts of living brass hurtled headlong into cold-blooded colossi, while above, flying reptiles battled bat-winged behemoths for control of the skies. Despite mauling their daemonic foes, the Lizardmen were driven back.\\n\\nThe Slann drew ever more upon their nexus of power, using its grounding to steady the unstable energies swirling around them. In desperation, they enchanted the jungle, turning their surroundings into a deathtrap full of carnivorous plants, living quicksand pits and teeming swarms of insects whose stings could crack Dragon scale. Rivers were redirected to impede the daemonic advance and volcanoes rose and erupted to slow their hellish progress. Yet still, the fell legions rampaged onwards. The Lizardmen withdrew to their temple-cities, bastions of order amongst a sea of Chaos.\\n\\nFor a time, even the relentless minions of the Dark Gods were checked as the Lizardmen exacted a tremendous toll. Giant reptilian beasts waded into the tumult, crushing paths through the hellish hordes before being lost to sight beneath the writhing masses. Strange devices left by the Old Ones were unleashed, artefacts of power that melted away the opposition by the thousands. Heedless of their losses, the Daemons continued to batter away at the protective barriers conjured by the Slann to protect each temple-city.\\n\\nEventually, the Daemons devised a way to breach the wards and Xahutec was the first to fall, its inhabitants slaughtered and its sky-scraping pyramids cast down. It began a chain reaction, weakening the magical barriers erected over each other temple-city in turn. So Huatl, Tlanxla, and Xhotl fell in quick succession.\\n\\nAt Xhotl, the Slann Mage-Priests managed to hold out long enough to send warnings to the remaining cities, allowing them to employ suitable counterspells. The Daemons were stymied for a period, yet they were unrelenting.\\n\\nThey devised new devilries to defeat each defence, unleashing a plague to overcome Chaqua, levelling Quezotec with the sonic barrage of a billion slaughtered souls in agony, and summoning shadowy tentacles to drag the great triangular temple-city of Zarmuda deep under the sea, where its force dome eventually cracked. After a thousand years of battle, only a handful of temple-cities stood, each a bastion protected by the greatest of the remaining Slann.\\n\\nAcross the globe, the younger races also faced the Daemon legions. Despite retreating to their mountain holds, the Dwarfs had been decimated. The Elves of Ulthuan suffered tremendous loss, but in the end, their mages enacted the Great Ritual – a spell that created a vast vortex that drained away swathes of the magic that flooded the world. Deprived of their lifeblood of magical energy, the Daemons disappeared back to their seething realm. Yet the world was irrevocably damaged, now transformed into a world saturated with magic and monsters.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_ruminations_new_age_description	After the devastating events of the Great Catastrophe, the Slann ordered their minions to begin reconstructing that which they could. This task was urgent and gave the Mage-Priests time to meditate upon the proper way to advance. The struggle for survival against the Daemons had allowed no time to contemplate a future bereft of the Old Ones.\\n\\nThe Lizardmen were uninterrupted during their rebuilding, as the rest of the civilised races were also recovering from war, and because Lustria had grown treacherous. To tread upon that continent was to invite death, as predatory beasts, tropical diseases and all manner of deadly flora still remained – the residual effect of the Slann’s many defensive spells and, perhaps, the corrupting taint of Chaos.\\n\\nIt was the intention of the Slann to fortify their own defences before re-establishing contact with the younger races. They certainly intended to continue their monitoring duties and most probably their mentoring roles to those under-developed projects begun by the Old Ones. But in this new age, the Slann soon discovered that even their best-constructed designs now seemed error-prone and displeasingly flawed. Details slipped away from the leaders of the Lizardmen, and they spent much time contemplating why.\\n\\nThe Slann struggled to remember the rituals they had routinely performed before the coming of Chaos. Over a thousand years had passed since those days, and there were no longer any Slann of the First Spawning to guide them – none had survived. Of those Slann that remained, there was not one amongst their number that had entered the presence of an Old One.\\n\\nIt was a lengthy task simply establishing which nodes of the Geomantic Web were still serviceable, as many sites had been damaged or destroyed. The Great Cataclysm had a lingering effect upon the Slann, for they had looked into the swirl of pure Chaos and that image had imprinted itself upon their orderly minds. It clouded their consciousnesses and dim med their memories. Long rests were required to sustain them after serious bouts of deeper thinking. Yet despite the fact that they were but shadows of their former selves, the Slann remained masters of the mystic arts, their arcane skills unsurpassed by other mortals.\\n\\nAlthough the Great Ritual of the Elves had driven much of the power of Chaos away, it had not banished it entirely. The poles of the world still writhed under its corrupting sway and the world still suffered an influx of its energies, ebbing and flowing in a patternless way.\\n\\nThe Slann identified the tremendous threats already seeking to undermine the Elves’ vortex at the centre of their island home of Ulthuan. Were it to stop draining the world’s magic, the Daemons would soon reappear. Thus did the Slann begin their greatest undertaking of this new age.\\n\\nWhat remained of the Geomantic Web was used to strengthen the Great Warding – a string of lesser siphons, defences and sentinels that would keep the Realm of Chaos at bay and secretly lend its power to the vortex of the Elves. Many Mage-Priests spent the following millennia attending exclusively to this task alone.\\n\\nThe remaining Slann set about piecing together the Great Plan. Immediately before the Great Catastrophe, the Old Ones had dictated instructions and predictions onto many plaques of stone or gold. The remnants of the god-like beings’ intentions were now scattered throughout the world, often buried in ruins.\\n\\nThose sacred plaques that were recovered were studied and their meanings mulled over. Since those days, the Lizardmen have continued to scour the world in order to recover more such artefacts. Even the suspicion of such an item being found is sufficient to rouse a Mage-Priest from deep contemplation, and for a mighty host to be dispatched to retrieve it.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_the_five_spawnings_description	There were five spawnings of Slann created by the Old Ones after they arrived on the world, and none have been spawned since their departure. The Slann of the First Generation Spawning were the builders of the first temple-cities.\\n\\nThey were the most powerful of the Mage-Priests and the only beings permitted to enter the presence of the Old Ones, perhaps because no other living creature had the mental or physical strength to cope with the experience. They died many thousands of years ago and their bodies were embalmed, to be kept within the sacred temples as venerated relics.\\n\\nOf the Second Generation Spawning, originally spawned to help alter the world’s alignment and orbit, there are only five remaining. These surviving Mage-Priests are immensely old, perhaps the oldest creatures in existence, and they rule the greatest of the temple-cities.\\n\\nYounger by several thousand years are the Slann of the Third Generation, who aided in the construction of the lesser temple-cities, where they rule to this day. Their numbers are few, with possibly less than twenty remaining in existence.\\n\\nThe Mage-Priests of the Fourth Generation are more numerous, and were spawned to attend to the warp gates above the poles and to aid in the creation of the World Pond, the great separation of the continents.\\n\\nIn haste, the Fifth Generation was spawned mere centuries before the great catastrophe. Youngest and most numerous of the Slann, though still old enough to remember a time before Elves or Dwarfs, the Fifth Generation Mage-Priests are the most active and aggressive of the Slann.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_the_amazons_description	Stories of the legendary Amazons, an all-female tribe said to dwell within the jungle depths, have been told since folk from the Old World first arrived in Lustria.\\n\\nIn the Old World, the few scholars who purport that Amazons exist tend to claim that these women were outcasts from Skeggi. This theory was recorded in the [[i]]Journeys to the Dark Heart[[/i]], by the brilliant yet notoriously eccentric scholar of Geographic Lore at the University of Altdorf, Professor Stilmensch.\\n\\nStilmensch claimed that after a series of battles around the settlement had decimated the menfolk of Skeggi, a band of their women set sail for the south. They landed on a swampy island in the Amaxon estuary. The ruins of several Lizardman temples remained on the island, and the women inhabited and fortified them.\\n\\nWhen explorers from the Old World explored the island centuries later, they encountered the descendants of the women of Skeggi. They claimed the women had taken up the worship of Lizardman gods, were able to wield powerful weaponry of arcane manufacture, and had even figured out how to spawn in the manner of Skinks.\\n\\nOther more controversial scholars have written that the Amazons were an entirely separate yet related species created by the gods for a specific divine purpose, although this theory is commonly derided by authorities on such matters.\\n\\nRegardless, the mythology of the Amazons continues to flourish, and tales of vicious warrior-women wielding strange weapons of power can still be heard in the drinking dens of Swamp Town and Sartosa.\\n\\nLizardmen have a fractious relationship with the Amazons. The feeling is mutual – the Amazons keep Lizardmen away from the Shrine of Rigg just as they do Old Worlders. The Mage-Priests do not understand how the Amazons or their goddess fit into their equations and instruct their vassals to keep away from them.\\n	false

Their main troops, large bipedal man-lizards, are seemingly immune to pain, fighting on long after foes with any sense would have fled.”\\n\\nTime and again I have seen them fight to the last, pausing only to tug crossbow bolts from their thick hides. Even in death I have seen these creatures attack, in one case a severed head continued snapping at us for three full days, and in another, the jaws, once clamped onto flesh, could not again be prised opened, but had to be cut away from the victim – a process none could survive.”\\n\\n“The smaller, smooth-skinned creatures are less hardy, but are no less dangerous. Like little darting lizards, they speed in and out of cover, and their use of poison-tipped weapons has ensured that any that are captured suffer painful death. Worse still, at times the smaller race fights alongside Troll-sized reptile-men, hulking beasts that can tear a man in two. With their two-handed mauls I am sure such beasts could stove in the side of a ship within a few blows.”\\n\\n“But it is the larger creatures I fear the most – enormous reptiles the size of Giants, ravenous monsters that broke our battle lines and reduced many of our ships to kindling. Now that I have seen Lustria with my own eyes I believe the tales are true – both of the gold that can be pried out of every ruin, and also of the denizens of that cursed land.

A delegation of Mage-Priests, one from each of the extant temple-cities, congregates in the ‘Chamber of Words yet Unvoiced’ at the pyramid’s apex.\\n \\nJust before the sun rises, the Mage-Priests combine their vast powers, mouthing a potent invocation. At the ritual’s climax, the great square before the pyramid is filled with ranks of insubstantial figures, and the ruined city and its tumbledown temples appear pristine once more.\\n\\nThe figures are the ancient defenders of Tlax, as they were before they marched out to face the Daemons at the height of the Great Catastrophe. Though the Mage-Priests cannot communicate with the ghosts, they bestow upon them as much power as they can spare, so that the defenders might hold off the forces of Chaos that destroyed the city in ancient times.\\n\\nAnd then the sun breaks over the horizon and the ghosts fade away as the city returns to its ruined state once more. It is a matter of deep conjecture amongst the oldest of the Slann whether the ritual allows the defenders of Tlax to hold the city as long as they did, or whether the accumulation of power over the millennia may one day enable the past to be changed and the temple-city to stand.\\n	false

The Mage-Priests, for example preside over all manner of ceremonies, yet remain impassive throughout. A Mage-Priest might be carried to the high altar to officiate at a ceremony and remain in his meditation trance all the while, unaware or uncaring of events around him.\\n\\nIt is the Skink Priests that actually carry out the many and varied observances, abasements and rites associated with each Old One. The Saurus too pay homage to the lost gods, though these single-minded warriors do so in their own, simple ways.\\n\\nThey may heap the bodies of fallen enemies before a totem to the warrior-defender Quetzl, for example, or swallow whole the still-beating hearts of the vanquished in honour of Tzcatli, he who grants strength to a warrior’s arm. Even the Kroxigor make obeisance to the gods of the Lizardmen, the jungle resounding with low, rumbling chants as the sun rises.\\n\\nPerhaps once, before the Greta Catastrophe, the Lizardmen communicated directly with their masters, or had no need to do so at all, all their needs predicted and met. So long after the departure of the Old Ones however, the Lizardmen go to ever-greater lengths to enact the will of their lost gods.\\n\\nA mighty force might march to war, crossing the entire continent because a particular alignment of the stars demanded it. A beaten enemy army, its back to the sea, might be spared complete destruction because a Mage-Priest perceived the will of the Old Ones in the pattern of a sandshark’s footprints across the beach.\\n	false

Their status will be apparent from their appearance and demeanour; and the Skink Priests will record every nuance for the archives.\\n\\nLizardmen spawned according to the influence of Sotek, for example, often sport tall red crests and are warlike in character; while those spawned under Tepoc’s inscrutable eye may have purple or violet markings and a distinctly detached and otherworldly air.\\n\\nIt has happened that some spawnings are created under the influence of several Old Ones, exhibiting a combination of characteristics, and the Priests will take special care to record every last detail of such an event.\\n\\nOn extremely rare occasions, more than one of these spawnings have occurred in the same temple-city at the same time. Thus has been formed a Sacred Host, an entire army touched by a single god and marked with the signs of his blessing. Such an army is only spawned once in a thousand years, but will have some truly momentous task to complete for the furtherance of the Great Plan of the Old Ones.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_lost_treasures_gods_description	The Old Ones were said to have been masters of the mystic arts, engineers of reality who could manipulate the very fabric of space and time with but a thought. They created a great many devices which they gifted to their subject races, so that their servants might wield but a portion of the Old Ones’ own powers in the pursuance of the Great Plan.\\n\\nWhen the Old Ones departed the world, a large number of these devices were lost with them or destroyed when the delicate workings were overwhelmed in the magical hurricane that followed the collapse of the polar gates. Other such devices did survive the Great Catastrophe, however; and these are commonly wielded in battle by the greatest of the Lizardmen’s warriors and leaders.\\n\\nThe operation of many of these magical artefacts has long ago turned from science to superstition. The Lizardmen have no idea how the Staff of Light is powered, for example, only that by gripping the haft strongly whilst pointing it towards their enemy and invoking the name of Chotec it will unleash a blast of blinding light that will vaporise foes and reduce them to ash. Other items require no specific knowledge to utilise, such as the Maiming Shield, which appears to strike out at the wielder’s foes with a volition all its own.\\n\\nIt is recorded that there exist great repositories of magical devices that the Lizardmen have lost all knowledge of operating. Each of the temple-cities houses such places, and they are guarded by resolute Temple Guard. Furthermore, some Skink Priests hold that there exist places outside of the Lizardmen’s control, such as the legendary Temple of Kara, where the most powerful of artefacts are stored, attended by the warrior-women of the jungle tribes and kept secret even from the servants of their creators.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_treasure_hunters_description	The Norse were but the first Men to make the arduous journey across the Great Ocean to the so-called ‘New World’. While the High Elves of Ulthuan had retained at least a vestige of knowledge of their heritage, the race of Man had entirely forgotten the role the Old Ones had played in weaning their race towards civilisation. And so, in his lusty greed for gold and treasure, Man came to Lustria from every corner of the Old World and beyond. Yet, although many came, few found anything more than a painful death in the alien jungles.\\n\\nThe raiders and explorers found the jungles strewn with sites ripe for plunder. Many such places were of great importance to the Lizardmen, and to trespass within them was, inevitably, to bring down swift and terrible violence.\\n\\nFor a thousand years, the Lizardmen endured these raids. Few penetrated more than a dozen miles inland, while the Dark Elves remained a threat due to their use of the Black Way. In the grand scheme of things, most of these raids were of little consequence to the Mage-Priests, who barely registered the presence of the intruders. They had far greater matters on which to focus their meditations.\\n\\nThe Slann Mage-Priests could not fathom the young races’ taste for gold, but in general refrained from violent action unless an item of true significance was stolen. Over time, various settlements would be founded, but their occupants would invariably provoke attack from the Lizardmen, their greed spelling out their own doom.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_temple_cities_description	Temple-cities are both wonderful and often incomprehensible to outsiders. Their buildings are formed from stone cut to precise dimensions, held together without mortar. Lizard-sphinxes, stylised snakes, and colourful murals cover every surface.\\n\\nOver everything loom many-stepped pyramids, a constant reminder of the power this civilisation wields. Living temple-cities are constantly awash with activity, only subsiding during the coldest parts of the night. While temple-cities differ in character and purpose, there are some structures common to all. \\n\\nPyramid-temples are enormous ziggurats defended by Temple Guard at every level, their unblinking eyes watching the Skinks as they attend the resident Slann. A ziggurat may host many such venerable creatures, their age and status designated by how high their chambers are situated. The foremost Slann resides at the peak, within their temple’s Star Chamber, the elevation separating their thoughts from the discordant world.\\n\\nWithin the pyramid are chambers dedicated to many purposes. Some, like the Calendar Chamber, let light in through carefully aligned holes, marking significant occasions on the walls. Others hold sacred golden plaques, a record of the Old Ones’ Great Plan. Priests attend these constantly, puzzling out the Plan’s next course.\\n\\nMost sacred are the Tomb Chambers, where lie the revered Relic Priests. These chambers remain sealed except in the direst of circumstances, or when ritual demands a particular Slann’s presence, even if they died long ago.\\n\\nDeep below lie the Saurus’ spawning caverns. These are connected to their barracks and the Saurus defend them with utter dedication and ferocity. When not patrolling or training, the Saurus keep to their barracks and the company of their spawn fellows.\\n	false

gen_lore_lzd_the_pantheon_1_description	There are countless recorded Old Ones, and even the Slann do not know the identity of all of them. Some are lost, remembered only on a broken plaque or on the walls of a sealed chamber deep beneath the earth. Others now dominate Lizardman worship, with countless shrines and pyramids in the temple-cities.\\n\\n[[b]]Chotec, the Solar God[[/b]]\\nChotec is a god of the sun, who represents fire, energy, and warmth. The relentless heat that beats down on Lustria is a blessing by Chotec that gives the Lizardmen vigour and life. There are temples of Chotec in all temple-cities, positioned so that the rising sun frames their apex each day. The greatest temple is at Hexoatl, where Lord Mazdamundi leads Chotec’s major rites at the head of thousands of devoted Lizardmen.\\n\\nChotec favours fiery orange and burning gold. Those with its mark move a little faster and make more rash decisions.\\n\\n[[b]]Tzunki, the Water God[[/b]]\\nThe Old One Tzunki is master of the sea, rain, rivers, and spawning pools. Just as Chotec gifts the cold-blooded Lizardmen the heat they need to live, Tzunki nurtures and sustains them. There are depictions of Tzunki with an alligator as its totem animal and others of a batrachian figure rather like a Slann. Fifty miles off the coast of the Isthmus of Lustria is the Monument of the Moon, a singular monolith inscribed with a lengthy account of Tzunki’s domains.\\n\\nTzunki’s colours are green and turquoise. Lizardmen with Tzunki’s mark are agile, with webbed extremities and an affinity for water. They are not harmed by piranhas, pliodons, or the other denizens of Lustria’s rivers, lakes, and coast.\\n\\n[[b]]Tepok, the Inscrutable[[/b]]\\nTepok’s domain is the air, wisdom, and sacred places. It protects the Lizardmen from harmful magic and embodies mystical contemplation and otherworldliness. The Old One’s totem creature is the Coatl. These serpent creatures are as inscrutable as the god itself, and their relation to Tepok is mysterious to the Lizardmen.\\n\\nThose with Tepok’s blessing have rich purple markings and scales. They are instinctively drawn to sacred places — nodes on the Geomantic Web and sacred sites.\\n	false

It embodies the cold-blooded detachment inherent to the reptilian temperament. The moon Old Worlders call Mannslieb is associated with Tlazcotl — Skinks say it is the god’s eye watching calmly from the heavens. The temple-city of Tlaxtlan was supposedly built by the god.\\n\\nTlazcotl’s tones are yellows that blend into pale green. The Lizardmen bearing the god’s mark are unusually patient and restrained.\\n\\n[[b]]Huanchi, the Jaguar God[[/b]]\\nLike its totem jaguar, Huanchi stalks silently at night, hunting its prey across the face of the earth. It gave the Lizardmen the gift of stealth and the ability to see in the dark. It is invoked before Skinks hunt in the jungle for game or enemies. Huanchi is secretive and its rituals hidden from view.\\n\\nLizardmen sacred to Huanchi bear no visible mark. Instead, they are preternaturally stealthy and prefer the shadowed undergrowth of the jungle to the bright Lustrian sun.\\n\\n[[b]]Quetzl, the Protector God[[/b]]\\nThe Old One Quetzl is a warrior god, embodying resilience, defence, and protection. It favours stoicism and resistance to force. Quetzl’s spiked glyph reflects the tough scales of a Lizardman’s hide. It can be found carved on the defensive walls of temple-cities.\\n\\nLizardmen marked by Quetzl have thicker hides and scales. They are brave and resolute, slow to change their stance both physically and mentally. Jade Magister Cryston von Danling wrote that during an attack on Port Reaver, he saw a Saurus withstand a direct shot by a cannon, protected by Quetzl’s blessing.\\n\\n[[b]]Itzl, Ruler of Beasts[[/b]]\\nItzl has dominion over the reptilian beasts of Lustria, those that serve the Lizardmen and those that remain untamed. A three-horned entity, it is wilder than the other Old Ones. Itzl’s temples lie deep in the jungles and forests. Given its prominence in the first city, Itza, the Old One may have once been more integral to the pantheon.\\n\\nThose marked by Itzl are at ease in the company of Cold Ones and other beasts of burden.

The Serpent God is a new addition to the pantheon and not an Old One, although there is some protracted debate on this matter amongst the Slann. Sotek’s coming was prophesied, and it gave the Lizardmen increased fervour in fighting invaders. Yet the Mage-Priests are unnerved by the unexpected arrival of Sotek’s bloody cult and its grip over the Skink population.\\n\\nSotek represents the need for bloody vengeance. Skink Priest Tehenhauin carried the Prophecy of Sotek through plague-wracked settlements and inspired the Skinks to pray and sacrifice to the coming god. Since then, the cult has grown with each slaughter of Skinks by invaders. Veneration of the Snake God is led by Skink Priests and those who bear Sotek’s mark – reddish patterns on scales and skin. Its temples rise high in the cities, rivalling the Old Ones’ monuments in grandeur.\\n\\nSacrifice is essential to worshipping Sotek. The Skink Priests devoted to the Snake God believe that it demands the death of warm-bloods in its name – especially the hated Skaven. On several occasions, Sotek responded to this bloody devotion by sending a colossal serpent avatar to devour the enemies of the Lizardmen.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_doom_kavzar_1_description	Once upon a time, long long ago, Men and Dwarfs lived together beneath the roofs of one great city. Some said it was the oldest and greatest city in the world and had existed before the time of the longbeards and manlings, built by older and wiser hands in the dawn of the world.\\n\\nThe city lay both above and below the earth, in keeping with the nature of the populace that dwelt there. The Dwarfs ruled in their great halls of stone below ground and wrestled the fruits of the rock free with their day-long toil, while the manlings reaped the fields of swaying corn that surrounded the city with a patchwork blanket of gold. The sun smiled, men laughed, and everyone was happy.\\n\\nOne day the men of the city decided that they should give praise to their gods for their good fortune. They planned a temple such as the world had never seen before. In the central square a colossal hall would be built and topped with a single, cloud-piercing tower. A tower so tall it would touch the very heart of heaven. After much planning, with the help of the longbeards they set about their monumental task.\\n\\nWeeks became months and months became years and still the manlings built. Men grew old and grey working on that great temple, their sons continuing their work through summer sun and winter rain. At last, after many generations, work began on the great spire. Years passed and the tower reached such a height that the manlings found it ever more difficult to take the stone up to the top.\\n\\nEventually the work slowed to a crawl and finishing the tower seemed impossible. Then one came among the men of the city who offered his help in their great scheme. He asked a single boon of them in return and claimed that if they would grant it he would complete the tower in a single night. The manlings said to themselves, “What have we to lose?” and offered to make a bargain with the grey-clad stranger. All he wished was to add his own dedication to the gods onto the temple structure. The manlings agreed and the bargain was struck.\\n	false

Clouds swept over the moons, cloaking the temple in darkness as the manlings left. All over the city, men watched and waited as the hours slipped past until, near midnight, by ones and twos, they gathered again in the temple square.\\n\\nThe wind blew and the clouds parted as they gazed up at the temple. It rose like an unbroken lance against the sky, pure and white. At its very peak a great horned bell hung gleaming coldly in the moonlight. The stranger’s dedication to the gods was there but of the stranger there was no sign.\\n\\nThe manlings rejoiced that their fathers’ fathers’ work was done. They surged forward to enter the temple. Then, at the stroke of midnight, the great bell began to toll, once... twice... thrice. Slow, heavy waves of sound rolled across the city. Four... five.... six times the bell rang, like the torpid pulse of a bronze giant.\\n\\nSeven... eight... nine, the tolling of the bell grew louder with each ring, and the manlings staggered back from the temple steps clutching their ears. Ten... eleven... twelve... thirteen. At the thirteenth stroke lightning split the skies and thunder echoed the sound. High above, the dark circle of Morrslieb was lit by a bright flash and all fell ominously silent.\\n\\nThe manlings fled to their beds, frightened and puzzled by the portents they had seen. Next morning they arose to find that darkness had come to their city. Brooding storm clouds reared above the rooftops and such rain fell as had never been seen before. Black, like ash, the rain fell and puddled in the streets, slicking the cobbles with darkly iridescent colours.\\n\\nAt first some of the manlings did not worry, they waited for the rains to stop so that they might resume their work. But the rains did not stop, the winds blew stronger and lightning shook the high tower.\\n	false

The manlings became fearful and prayed to their gods. Still the rains did not stop and the black clouds hung like a shroud over the fields of flattened corn. The manlings went to the Dwarfs and beseeched their help. The longbeards were unconcerned – what matter a little rain on the surface? In the bosom of the earth all was warm and dry.\\n\\nNow the manlings huddled in their dwellings, fear gnawing at their hearts. They sent some of their number to faraway places to seek help, but none of them returned. Some went to the temple to pray and sacrifice their dwindling food to the gods but found its great doors were sealed shut. The rains grew heavier.\\n\\nDark hailstones fell from the sky and crushed the sodden crops. The great bell tolled a death knell over the terrified city. Soon great stones cleft the heavens, rushing down like dark meteors to smash the homes of the manlings. Many sickened and died from no apparent cause, and the newborn babes of the manlings were hideously twisted. Skulking vermin devoured what little stored corn there was left and the manlings began to starve.\\n\\nThe manling elders went to see the Dwarfs again and this time demanded their help. They wanted to bring their folk below ground to safety, they wanted food. The longbeards grew angry, and told the manlings that the lower workings were flooded and their food had also been devoured by rats. There remained barely enough food and shelter for them and their kinsmen. They cast the manlings out of their halls and closed their doors tight.\\n	false

But none came – instead the vermin returned, bigger and bolder than ever.\\n\\nTheir slinking, furred shapes infested the broken city, feasting on the fallen and pulling down the weak. Each midnight the bell tolled thirteen times on high, seeming now brazen and triumphant. The manlings lived as hunted creatures in their own city as great rat packs roamed the streets in search of prey.\\n\\nAt last the desperate manlings took up such weapons as they had and beat upon the Dwarfs’ doors, threatening that if they did not emerge they would drag them out by their beards. No reply came from within. The manlings took up beams and battered down the doors to reveal the tunnels below, dark and empty.\\n\\nSteeling themselves, the pitiful remnants of the city’s once-proud populace descended. In the ancient hall of kingship they found the Dwarfs, now naught but gnawed bones and scraps of cloth. And there they saw by the dying light of their torches the myriad eyes about them, glittering like liquid midnight as the rats closed in for the kill.\\n\\nThe manlings stood back to back and fought for their lives, but against the implacable ferocity and countless numbers of the verminous horde their weapons were useless. The tide of monstrous rats flowed over them one by one, dragging them down to be torn apart, the yellow chisel-teeth sinking into their soft flesh, the dark furred mass drowning their pitiful screams with their hideous chittering.\\n\\nTranslated from the Tilean tale “The Doom of Kavzar” also called “The Curse of Thirteen”.\\n\\n[[b]]Andreas Cameras[[/b]]\\n[[i]]Emeritus Professor of Imperial History, The Royal Academy, Altdorf[[/i]]\\n	false

Battles between the Children of the Horned Rat and Greenskins are common, with both sides seeking to wipe the other out by any means possible.\\n\\nHowever, as neither side has anything resembling scruples, alliances of convenience can happen when both sides see an advantage. When they can, Skaven manipulate any slow-witted Orc leaders (which is just about all of them) into doing all of the dirty work. Such pacts are always broken, and the only real question is which side turns betrayer first.\\n\\nNight Goblins, although less brutish than their Orcish cousins, are shrewd, and therefore much tougher opponents in a prolonged war. Night Goblins in particular compete with Skaven for the best lairs (often old Dwarfholds) and so any Warlord worth his sharp, pointy incisors will do his utmost to slay or enslave any Night Goblin tribes that get within striking distance of his clan!\\n	false

The current dictates of rulership were laid down by the Horned Rat upon the Black Pillar of Commandments over two centuries ago. It must have been intended for the system to be as complex and intricate as possible. Scheming and plotting come naturally to Skaven, and it is doubtless the Great One Draws endless amusements from the machination of the Lords of Decay as they twist and turn within his convoluted laws.\\n\\nThe positions on the Council command a descending order of precedence. The first and twelfth places (the right and left hand of the Horned Rat) are the most important seats and the sixth and seven places are the least. However, any Lord of Decay can abstain and by so doing veto a command from his ‘opposite number’.\\n\\nHence, Lord Kritislik, the Seerlord, can (and so frequently does) veto the orders of Lord Morskittar, the Lord-Warlock of Clan Skryre. This means that the Lords of Decay often need the help of others to set their schemes in motion.\\n\\nThus the circle of maze-like plots continues, encouraging ever-shifting dynamics, blackmail, bribery, and all manner of corruption. Assassination attempts amongst the Lords of Decay are considered rather crude, but are not unheard of. It is more likely that the lower clans or even outside kingdoms will be manipulated, which in turn will affect the actions of the Council of Thirteen.\\n	false

Some particular units or clans are known for unusual hues, such as the Albino Council Guard that protects the Lords of Decay or the red-dyed fur of Clan Vulkn.

gen_lore_skv_treacherous_progression_description	The progression from Stormvermin to Fangleader to Chieftain to Warlord is common,  although not as traditional as betrayal. Stormvermin are linked to a clan leader, serving as his bodyguard and the enforcers of his will. Opposition to a leader is regularly met with butchery, and an armoured cadre of Stormvermin is ideal to do such work.\\n\\nTo ensure their strong-arm regiments remain loyal, cunning leaders lavish attention, praise and, most importantly, gifts upon ‘their’ Stormvermin. Food, Skavenslaves (often the same thing) and breeding rights are popular motivators. Particular ferocity, anticipating treachery, or eating the existing Fangleader are the standard ways of rising from the Stormvermin ranks. Once established, a Fangleader that can keep his leader safe while savagely carrying out commands can virtually name his price.\\n\\nAs treachery abounds, bribing a Fangleader is a common tactic. Amidst the double and triple crossings, baseless pacts, and false promises, a Fangleader is quickly immersed in the only training that can forge a black-hearted Chieftain, wicked and wily in the ways of both battle and intrigue.\\n\\nFew Chieftains survive without the support of a core of fighters, so when (almost invariably) a Fangleader makes his move to replace a Chieftain, he will assure the support of at least some Stormvermin. A top lieutenant takes the vacated role of Fangleader and so the cyclical dynamics of power shift. A common and astute phrase amidst Warlord clans is “A Chieftain is only as big as his Stormvermin”.\\n	false

Known for its cheese and the plumpness of its livestock, there are none now living that know of Glumund’s darker, more ominous past.\\n\\nDuring the years of the Black Plague, the fertile farmlands were turned into a shanty-camp where the captured citizens of the Empire were driven and collected behind crude stockades, before being herded into tunnels from whence none returned. The many caves that surround the town have long been filled in and the few written records of those black days were lost in the great fires of Altdorf.\\n\\nAnd so it was a matter of wonder and speculation, not foreboding, when in the Imperial year of 2517 the town of Glumund simply ceased to be. Not a single merchant plied the streets, nor farmer tilled the fields. The citizens disappeared in the night, never to be seen again.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_latest_upgrades_description	Typically a Master Moulder can’t stop tinkering and adjusting the fleshy creations he has grown in vats, bred, and stitched together. Can it function with an additional arm? Will the pincer from a Chaos beast graft on or will it attack itself? How can more growing agents be squeezed out of prisoners to better enrich new creations?\\n\\nParticularly large or successfully mutated creatures are known as Master-bred Rat Ogres, and they are the most powerful of their bloodthirsty kind. As might be expected, these muscled behemoths vary greatly in form.\\n\\nSome Master Moulders might create multiple-headed monstrosities, while others will breed for sheer muscle bulk, submerging their creations in vats of growth agents for months. One stable Rat Ogre variant is the Bonebreaker, a hulking creation much valued as a mount by discerning Warlords.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_triumph_viskis_description	Warlord Viskis puffed himself up to his verminous fullness and gazed down upon his Chieftains as they entered the hall through the blasted archway. They were wary, but could not hide their awe at the size of the many-pillared hall and the bodies and broken armaments piled in the corners.\\n\\nViskis wasn’t going to miss this opportunity. Everything was as he had arranged. Black-furred Stormvermin were arrayed in ranks, formidable in their size and thick, plated armour. He himself, most potent of commanders, was several tiers higher, pacing on the carven stone dais of the ancient and ornate throne room.\\n\\nThe runes of the hated bearded-things had been hastily scratched out, covered by the markings of the Great Horned Rat and the great claws of Clan Gritus. Warlord Viskis himself was backlit by the sole light source – a vast brazier glowing with warpstone-laced shards. Viskis cast his shadow across all as they had to look up at him, his fur outlined by the green tint of the balefire.\\n\\n“Now, hear-listen what I have to say. Long-long have we fought for this under-lair and now we stand in the Dwarf-things’ throne room. Their king-thing sat here. I, Warlord Viskis, have eaten him.”\\n\\nA pause here allowed Viskis to turn, showing off his newly bulging profile. Squeaking whispers let Viskis know his deed was marked with proper awe. The Dwarf-leader was a mighty warrior and had slain many Skaven. “We must take-take the other levels, kill-kill all that remain. The following is MY plan...”\\n\\n“But great leader” said Chieftain Sszark of Clan Gritus exactly on cue, “why isn’t Priest Grostle here?” He referred to the Plague Priest leader of the large Clan Pestilens faction, which, up until now had been leading the underground assault.\\n\\n“Grostle fell and I am in command,” announced Viskis. The Chieftains and Clawleaders craned their necks and sniffed, anxious to see the reaction amongst the remaining Plague Monks.\\n	false

I listen and decide. We contract to best-best offer, failed bid dies. Proceed.”\\n\\nThe representative from Clan Moulder stepped one pace forward and abased himself on the floor in the proper fashion. “Your honour.” he began. “Packlord Trask sends you his most special greetings and begs your mightiness to accept this small token of his respect – a jewelled dagger engraved with runes of power...” Seeing the Nightlord’s tail twitch impatiently, he hurried on to business. “According to bargain-law. Clan Moulder respectfully treaty-pledge twenty warp tokens, three packs of giant rats, two specially trained Rat Ogres...”\\n\\nWith a snarl of impatience, Hakflem, the representative from Clan Pestilens, thrust past the unctuous Packmaster. “Do not listen to this cowering fool!” he croaked. “My master, the great Nurglitch himself, makes treaty pledge of [[i]]thirty[[/i]] warp tokens, ten females in prime breeding condition, five weights of black corn and an engraved warpstone amulet. And he sends you this – and bids you remember the [[i]]Scarlet Scourge[[/i]]!”\\n\\nWith a dramatic gesture, he waved a small iron flask above his head. The Nightlord snarled in anger, and three of the black-furred guards leaped towards the offender, drawing their swords in mid-air.\\n\\n“Foul traitor!” squeaked the Packmaster in feigned outrage, nimbly darting out of the way.\\n\\nAs the three assassin-guards fell on top of Hakflem, he hurled the vial towards the Nightlord. In a blur of speed, the Nightlord snatched the spinning vial from the air. “So perish all those who dare defy me!” he squealed, as the guards hacked Hakflem’s body apart until nothing was left but a bloody mess of flesh, fur, and tatters of rag.\\n\\nOne of the guards pounced upon the Packmaster and dragged the cowering ratman forward. “Continue,” ordered the Nightlord. “And make it worth my while.”\\n\\n“Mighty Nightlord, most-favoured of the Horned One, Clan Moulder treaty-pledge [[i]]thirty-five[[/i]] warp tokens, [[i]]five[[/i]] packs of giant rats, [[i]]three[[/i]] Rat Ogres...”\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_doom_eight_peaks_description	The Dwarfs fought with all the stubborn tenacity of their kind, but were slowly forced back by the relentless Skaven advance. Dwarf axe chopped at black Skaven fur, Skaven sword crunched into Dwarf mail, spatters of blood flew overhead. The fitful glow of the torches on the tunnel wall illuminated a scene of relentless savagery. No quarter would be asked, nor no surrender given.\\n\\nThe Skaven pushed the Dwarfs back by sheer weight of numbers. For every ratman that fell another two fought each other to take its place. Rats swarmed round the feet of the combatants, feeding on the dead, and pulling down the injured of both sides.\\n\\nA wave of rats swarmed up Snorri’s long mail coat and attacked his face. Desperately trying to protect his eyes, he stumbled and fell. The Skaven rushed over his body and there was nothing the Dwarfs could do except close their ranks and add Snorri’s name to the list of fallen. If they survived, his bravery would be remembered.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs were fighting on the defensive, their orders to protect the Gate of Jewels, one of the access points that led onto the East Stair of Karak Eight Peaks. At first, a proud twenty-strong regiment, they had managed to repulse the Skaven and even drive them back, but now, with over two thirds of their number gone, they had been pushed back to the Gate itself.\\n\\nBacks pressed against the solid oak door, the Dwarfs could retreat no further; they would give their lives to protect the East Stair. Like a vital artery, it led straight to the heart of Karak Eight Peaks. If the Skaven broke through, the whole stronghold could fall, and another cornerstone of the Dwarfs’ heritage would be lost.\\n\\nPanting blood from their many wounds dripping down their armour, the Dwarfs silently committed their souls to Grungni. The Skaven stopped before the Gate, snarling and squeaking, and parted ranks to let two more of their kind through. The two newcomers were bigger and better armed than the other Skaven. One carried a strange gun-like weapon in his paws, which was connected by a flexible pipe to a band carried by the other.\\n\\n“Die-die, Dwarf-men!” squeaked the Skaven carrying the strange weapon, aiming the nozzle at the Dwarfs and pulling the trigger. With a fearsome whine, a stream of green-black fire shot forward and engulfed the Dwarfs.\\n\\nThe warpfire clung to their bodies, burned their hair, dissolved the flesh from their faces, ate through their armour. Within seconds, the proud Dwarf warriors were reduced to a smouldering mound of melted bone and metal scraps. With a snarl of triumph, the Skaven aimed his weapon at the centre of the Gate. Fingers of glowing warpfire clawed through the thick timbers, and the Doom of Karak Eight Peaks was assured.\\n	false

If the human army did include flying creatures – as was rumoured – they wouldn’t be able to see them coming until the very last minute.\\n\\nHe and the four jezzail teams under his command were positioned on top of a rocky hill to the west of the battlefield. On the plain below, he could see the valiant Skaven forces locked in combat with the Bretonnian army. A large regiment of Clanrat warriors had charged right into the middle of the enemy force, and he could see the Warlord’s banner bobbing up and down in the fray.\\n\\nTo the left of the main conflict, a unit of Stormvermin had engaged a regiment of cavalry. The soft-fleshed human warriors were entirely covered in metal armour – the weaklings – unlike the mighty Stormvermin, who were protected only by their thick black fur.\\n\\nOn the right, another, smaller, unit of mounted knights was cantering round towards the base of the hill. Throtvile gave the command to fire and the four jezzails rang out in unison. Waving a paw to clear the foul-smelling smoke he saw that two of the knights were down and the rest had drawn to a confused halt, trying to bring their horses under control.\\n\\nThe jezzail crews chittered with excitement as they reloaded and prepared to fire again. Throtvile’s whiskers bristled with pride as the next volley of shots downed another knight and the others wheeled round and fled. How he would remember this glorious day! He had single-handedly (well, almost) routed that huge regiment of enemy cavalry and...\\n\\n“For the Lady!” Throtvile was so surprised he nearly dropped his sword. Plummeting down from the clouds in a storm of wings came a fully armoured knight mounted on a brilliant white pegasus. Behind him the jezzail teams shrank back with fear. “Fire. FIRE!” yelled Throtvile, flinging himself to the ground and clamping his paws over his ears.\\n\\nToo shocked to disobey, the jezzail crews swivelled their guns and fired wildly at the pegasus. There was a succession of deafening explosions and a scream of pain. Throtvile raised his muzzle and looked up nervously. The pegasus lay on the ground, its white hide streaked with blood, one wing torn off. The knight lay motionless on the ground beside it.\\n\\nEmboldened, he scuttled forward, but froze in his tracks when the knight suddenly lurched to his feet, raising his heavy sword into the air. The old Skaven adage ‘He who runs away lives to fight another day’ flashed through Throtvile’s mind, and he turned tail and ran.\\n	false

The early morning mist still clung to the ground, and the advancing Skaven army looked as if they were swimming through white foam.\\n\\nFive Skaven scuttled ahead of rest, whirling spiked flails round their heads. Streams of greeny-yellow gas poured out of the spiked balls, spreading a pall of poisonous mist about them.\\n\\nThe knight charged his horse at the lead Skaven, bending down to swing his hammer at it. At the last minute, the horse panicked and shied. The knight was thrown to the ground with a thud of steel. Coughing as the foul air blistered his throat, he tried to struggle to his feet, but was knocked down again by a well-placed blow from the Skaven.\\n\\nThe spiked ball crunched into the knight’s unprotected head, leaving half his face a red ruin. As he toppled over, the Skaven leaped on top of him and tore open his throat. Mad with fear, the horse ran straight towards the ranks of the Skaven army, but within seconds it too succumbed to the lethal gas and sank beneath the swirling mist with a last despairing whinny of terror.\\n	false

Interwoven plots are unwound, restructured and planned anew. The mage-rats then perform many covenous rituals – cursing foes, offering supplication to the Gret Horned Rat, and also a spell intended to shroud the ratmen in secrecy.\\n\\nTaught the powerful sorcery by the darksome whispers of a summoned Vermin Lord, the Grey Seers lock tails, offer sacrifices and weave sorcerous webs of concealing shadow that only the strongest willed might resist.\\n\\nWho knows if this veil of obscurity works, or to what level it enshrouds the Children of the Horned Rat? Perhaps when a citizen of the Empire says “the Skaven are myth, simply tales used to frighten small children” he might speak out of sheer ignorance rather than beguiling enchantment?\\n\\nNever fully trusting the rituals, the Council of Thirteen further cover their verminous tracks with coven actions assigned to Clan Eshin. These particularly target Imperial records containing references to the Skaven.\\n\\nThe few human-possessed artefacts of the ratmen, such as the Rat Ogre skull that had been displayed in a museum in Nuln, or the Clan Skryre rebreather apparatus studied at the imperial Engineer’s School in Altdorf, have mysteriously vanished over the years.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_fall_rise_skavenblight_description	Little is known about the earliest Children of the Horned Rat after they overran the city that was to become Skavenblight. Perhaps they warred amongst themselves until only the strongest survived? Certainly they bred and began seeking more sources of warpstone. Regardless, it wasn’t until around 1600 years before the coming of Sigmar that the first true Skaven began to emerge out of the black pit of madness beneath the ruined city of Kavzar.\\n\\nThe numbers of Skaven grew rapidly, despite the starvation and disease already rife in Skavenblight. Pressure mounted to expand the tunnels, as the surface world was too dangerous, being full of beasts, Greenskins, and barbarous human tribes. The nascent Skaven sorcerers gathered in a grandiose scheme to open great rifts beneath the surface where the ratmen could rule supreme.\\n\\nAll their considerable quantities of warpstone were gathered to power a crude machine. It was hoped (and positively assured) that this arcane device would magnify the spell of the cabal of horned seers. The power to split rock, boulder, or mountain as to be at their command.\\n\\nDeep beneath Skavenblight, the invocation began. The diabolical device of spinning wheels, whirring gears, and makeshift power accumulators throbbed and smoked as it absorbed and magnified raw magic. The ground shook and the groans of shifting rock almost drowned out the shrill climax of the chanting seers.\\n\\nHigh above, the Great Bell of the indomitable tower of the Great Horned Rat tolled as the structure swayed and creaked like the mast of a ship at sea. Then, for the first time, but far from the last, the great device of the Skaven failed them. Some unknown part of the ingenious, yet imperfect device failed. Catastrophically. With a blinding flash, a tidal wave of raw magical power was unleashed upon the world.\\n\\nTunnels collapsed, buildings fell, and the land heaved and convulsed. The entire undermined plain sank as geysers of flame erupted from the tortured ground. The damage was even more devastating as the energy emanated outwards. As great tidal waves swept across the seas to the west, in the east the surging energy crashed against the underspines of the Worlds Edge Mountains, which had already undergone recent mystical upheaval.\\n\\nLong dormant volcanoes were rekindled to wrath and snow-capped peaks trembled. Lava, earthquakes, and landslides devastated the ancient realm of the Dwarf kings. The bearded ones we ill prepared for such calamity, drained as they were from their long war with the Elves.\\n	false

No building stood undamaged, save for the indomitable Temple of the Great Horned Rat, which still towered over the ruins. Slowly, small knots of Skaven dug their way out and emerged to stare at the devastation they had wrought.\\n\\nA great mass gathered around the temple, none daring to enter, although all knew they must seek the guidance of the Great Horned Rat. Even as they squabbled before the towering edifice, the great doors creaked open and twelve figures emerged, eerily backlit by the mystical lights within the temple.\\n\\nThe twelve grey-clad ratlords spoke with one voice to the assembled multitude. The time had come for the Children of the Horned Rat to spread across the world, to multiply in the dark places, to gather strength. The Great Horned Rat had whispered his plan, and it was the Lords of Decay, as they named themselves, who were to lead.\\n\\nIt took weeks to excavate back to the tunnels below, but when they reached the chamber of the machine, they discovered the seers had (at least partially) succeeded. Great cracks led away to blackness, into countless miles of dank, lightless passages that had been forgotten since the world was young.\\n\\nThe surviving Skaven were divided into twelve parts, each under one of the grey clad Lords of Decay. Some remained in Skavenblight, a few led their followers across the oozing plains, but most descended into the roots of the world. So the Children of the Horned Rat spread from the depths of the Under-city like a cancer. Never again could a single disaster wipe out the Skaven race. Within months, the ratmen were attacking the Dwarfs of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Soon enough, they would be everywhere.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_long_war_cripple_peak_description	Though the Skaven became a widespread race, most clans regularly sent operatives back to Skavenblight. So it was that word of the discovery of a great supply of warpstone travelled throughout the newly formed Under-way. In ancient times, a huge warpstone meteor had smashed into one of the southernmost of the Worlds Edge Mountains. The shattered mountain, known as Cripple Peak, still housed a motherlode of the darkly magical rock deep within its sundered core.\\n\\nOver time, erosion had carried warpstone dust far, turning the region into a barren and twisted land. The water of the sea glowed green and was haunted by mutated serpents of alarming size. It was here that Nagash, the father of necromancy, had chosen to settle.\\n\\nOver long years, Nagashizzar, the Cursed Pit, largest and most evil of fortresses, was constructed. Legions of Undead mined the warpstone below Cripple Peak to fuel the Great Necromancer’s power, while surviving human tribes on the surface worshipped Nagash as a god and willingly did his foul biddings.\\n\\nInitially, each Skaven clan greedily attacked Nagashizzar separately, barely denting the formidable fortress. Then the newly formed Council of Thirteen took over, jointly planning the attack. So it was that not one clan, but many hordes burst into Nagashizzar, seeking to overrun it from below as they had done already to many Dwarf mines.\\n\\nBut against the minions of Nagash they faced limitless numbers that never tired. Savage fights in the tunnels lasted for days, weeks, and months, but the Skaven could not wear down their foes. Warlocks of Clan Skryre arrived to break the deadlock, but from his throne, high above the battle in the mines, Nagash exerted his will and the Skaven spells briefly flickered then died. The war of attrition stretched from months to years to decades.\\n\\nDesperate to achieve victory, the Skaven struck the lands above, besieging Nagash’s human followers. The cities burned and the streets ran red with slaughter, but the humans feared Nagash more than torture of the ratmen. After a century of conflict, the Council realised that, at best, the war was a resource-draining stalemate.\\n\\nIt was at this time that the Council received shambling envoys from Nagash – an offer of a pact. In return for Skaven aid, Nagash would supply the ratmen with warpstone mined beneath Cripple Peak. After much deliberation, the Council agreed. Although they desired the warpstone for themselves alone, the Skaven warriors were not inexhaustible, and something was better than nothing. At least for the time being.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_the_great_ritual_description	After claw-marking a pact with Nagash, the Council of Thirteen ordered all Skaven to maintain a diplomatic distance while they attempted more stealthy methods to usurp the coveted warpstone he laid claim to at Cripple Peak. Most efforts failed, but by now the Skaven had discovered other significant sources of warpstone. When Nagash sent rotting emissaries offering the Council more warpstone for luring Orc tribes into the Cursed Pit, the Council redoubled their spying efforts to find out what Nagash was planning.\\n\\nAt first, the scuttling observers could learn little, save that the growing armies of the Liche Lord set sail onto the Sour Sea in ships of bone. Upon their return, the ships bore a single prisoner, a human king of some southern realm. Then something began which the Council needed no spies to report – a great and terrible gathering of dark power could be felt over Cripple Peak. Mounting storm clouds of energy heralded a mighty spell intended to reshape the world.\\n\\nNightmares stalked the surface world and portents of doom abounded. The Grey Seers were struck by visions and hurriedly the Council convened at Skavenblight. Using all the assets available to them, the Council scried far and wide for clues to Nagash’s intentions. To their shock, far to the south they found it flowing like a dusty river of bone.\\n\\nLiterally millions upon millions of restless dead were on the march, answering their summons to Nagashizzar. It was already the mightiest army the world had ever seen, and more dead were rising to join. Before such a host the living world would be snuffed out like a candle before a black whirlwind.\\n\\nDread gripped the Council – surely the Skaven would be amongst the first to feel the wrath of Nagash? The network of spies, observers, and lookouts relayed that all was silent in Nagashizzar, the Great Necromancer was in a trance after his monumental undertaking. The Council realised they must destroy Nagash before his rotting legions arrived, but how to confront such power? No Skaven could be trusted to master his fear.\\n\\nA scheme was suggested. In Nagash’s dungeons still languished the mysterious king. After his long torment, it was doubtless that he would relish an opportunity destroy his tormentor. The man-thing would need a weapon mighty enough to harm the Liche Lord. The weapon would be so lethal that to wield it assured certain death. It mattered not, as the unwitting user would be unaware that his own life was sapping away. The Council unanimously agreed on the plan (a first).\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_death_nagash_description	With utmost urgency, the Council forged a blade made of warpstone from Cripple Peak. The Grey Seers wove spells of doom into the molten metal. Clan Skryre Warlocks added dire-runes so deadly that to read them was death. A device was set into the pommel to allow the Council to see through the eyes of its wielder and to allow the Skaven to channel power to its bearer. Before the blade was cool, it was sheathed in lead and rushed through the Under-way using relay teams.\\n\\nUsing secret tunnels to gain access to Nagashizzar, the servants of the Council crept to the dungeons. Silently they freed the king and opened the lead casket before fleeing. The human grasped the sword and far away in Skavenblight the Lords of Decay willed him towards the throne room. Silently obeying, the king stalked empty corridors. Already the dust raised by the approaching Undead legions could be seen from atop Cripple Peak.\\n\\nIn the echoing darkness of the throne room, Nagash sat alone. With faltering steps the king approached, hesitating before the towering figure. Aided by the Council’s mental urgings, he struck. At the last moment, the Liche Lord raised a claw to ward off the blow. The fell-blade clove Nagash’s upraised wrist, but the Great Necromancer snapped out of his stupor to unleash a deadly blast at his assailant. The Council reeled as they strove to protect their pawn. Two ancient Lords fell dead as they helped to deflect the titanic energy.\\n\\nThe human went mad, hacking at Nagash, and at last the blade’s deadly enchantments took hold. Soon the iron-hard bones of the Liche Lord lay in a thousand pieces. As the human staggered away, already driven to madness or oblivion, the waiting Skaven cast Nagash’s remains into the warpforges, destroying them utterly. With his death, the Undead legions crumbled. Unknown to the rest of the world, the threat to all life was averted and the most powerful necromancer the world has ever known was slain by treachery.\\n	false

The clan, led by Warlord Graskk, a rising member of the Council, quickly established itself. The humans of Nagash’s empire were enslaved and over the following centuries never-before-seen amounts of warpstone flowed back to Skavenblight.\\n\\nNaturally, Clan Rikek rose to dominance. Over 300 yeasts later, a cowled stranger brashly approached the gates of Nagashizzar, now Fortress Rikek, demanding entry. The Clanrats eagerly swarmed out to seize the fool, but before they could close they froze in fear.\\n\\nGhouls slunk from the shadows. The figure gestured to the gates and the impenetrable doors swung open. Removing his hood, the skeletal face and glowing eyes of the Liche Lord were revealed. Nagash had returned from certain death and Clan Rikek was crushed in a single night.\\n\\nWhen the handful of survivors reached Skavenblight, the Council dispatched an army, and the fruitless long war was reborn anew. The Lords of Decay sought to glean information, eventually divining that Nagash was still mighty, but not as before. The warpstone was nearly exhausted, so the Skaven withdrew. Nagash remained in his stronghold, unassailable, but too weak to venture out. So it remained for many long centuries.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_rise_clan_pestilens_description	A new power arose from the jungles of Lustria. The clan was long forgotten and much changed since leaving Skavenblight. They had passed beyond the knowledge of the Council of Thirteen, but would one day return, eager for power.\\n\\nThe name of the clan that was led to the dry deserts of what is now Araby during the Great Migration is no longer remembered. How they found the tunnels beneath the Great Ocean to the jungle land of the cold-blooded ones is unrecorded. Yet the Skaven arose under a temple-city in deepest Lustria.\\n\\nAlthough the ratmen were accustomed to insect-filled swamps, the virulent tropical diseases began to take their toll. When the clan was reduced to only a few hundred surviving members, their fur soaked in cold sweat and their fevered brains wracked by insane visions, the clan was visited by an epiphany.\\n\\nIf they dedicated their lives to the Great Horned Rat, they would be spared. If they scoured the jungle for victims to sacrifice, the Great Horned One’s hunger would be appeased. If they grew to revere the very diseases that were killing them, they might be born anew. And so out of the darkest desperation, a new breed of Skaven emerged – the zealous Plague Monks of Clan Pestilens.\\n\\nThe Skaven that rose out of the crumbling temple-city were hideous, covered in weeping buboes, their pox-ridden bodies toughened by the very diseases they carried. Methodically, Clan Pestilens grew, plundering arcane secrets from the ruins over the centuries. Many of the cold-blooded reptilian creatures that sought to protect the jungle were sacrificed in the name of the Great Horned Rat. And always Clan Pestilens sought new ways to devote themselves to corruption.\\n\\nThe clan had grown strong and now Lord Nurglitch, the traditional name for the mightiest of the Plague Lords, deemed it was time for his brood to return. The pestilent host spent a decade fighting their way out of the jungle to the coast. From there, a hastily built fleet of ramshackle ships was constructed to carry the greater part of Clan Pestilens to the Southlands where several fortress lairs were established.\\n\\nEmissaries were sent to Skavenblight where the Lords of Decay convened. Clan Pestilens demanded breeding rights, tithes of warpstone, and positions on the Council. As expected, the emissaries were summarily butchered and their remains cast out of the city.\\n	false

Clan Merkit was flooded by great cauldrons filled with warpstone mixed with offal and putrescence. The Plague Monks used great bellows to ensure all the caverns were filled with the noxious fumes. Only Lord Merkit and his bodyguard escaped hideous death or enslavement.\\n\\nThe Council responded with armies of Clanrats, supported by some of the newly developed weaponry of Clan Skryre. Several Southland clans capitulated after the ruthless demonstration of the Plague Monks' power, and this provided Clan Pestilens the numbers to resist.\\n\\nAs years passed and the Council of Thirteen proved incapable of bringing the Plague Monks to heel, other Warlord clans split away. The rogue clans either joined the Plague Monks or made war for their own gain. Soon the Council of Thirteen lost all control of the Southlands. The Under-Empire was falling apart.\\n\\nFor nearly four hundred years, the Skaven remained divided: the north faction, led by the Council of Thirteen, and the south, by the Plague Lords. Many clans stood apart, joining sides with whoever had the upper hand. Plagues, sorcery, and double crossings were rife, but the war remained locked in stalemate. The deadlock was broken by the reappearance of anther long-lost clan, for the assassin-adepts of Clan Eshin had finally returned from the mysterious Far East.\\n\\nWhen the black-clad assassins of Clan Eshin pledged allegiance to the Council of Thirteen, the heads of Warlords, rebellious Chieftains, and Plague Lords themselves began to regularly disappear. Support swiftly eroded for Clan Pestilens. Realising their position was becoming untenable, the Plague Lords requested a parley.\\n\\nAfter surviving several assassination attempts on the way to Skavenblight, their representative, Nurglitch, based himself at the Great Temple of the Horned Rat and unreservedly placed the resources of his clan at the disposal of the Council of Thirteen. Furthermore, he informed them all that he was carrying a vial of Yellow Skull Fever and further attempts on his life would leave him no option but to release the contagion there in the very heart of Skavenhlight.\\n\\nThus were Clan Pestilens welcomed back and the Arch-Plague Lord Nurglitch earned the right to a trial by combat. Although it was a near thing, the Plague Lord used a poisonous bite to defeat his opponent – Lord Vask, the most vulnerable member of the Warlord clans on the Council. So Clan Pestilens joined the Council as the seventh seat, placing its resources at the disposal of the Lords of Decay.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_the_black_plague_description	In the winter of the year 1111, a new strain of disease developed by Clan Pestilens was delivered by Clan Eshin adepts into the wells and sewers of many cities of the Empire. The scourge spread like wildfire. The first signs of infection were ominous blotches on the skin, followed by swelling of joints and agonising fever.\\n\\nVictims could last from minutes to a few weeks before the disturbing final stages, when the afflicted writhed in convulsions for torturous hours. The lucky died quickly, and in death the corpse turned a dark ashen grey.\\n\\nThe plague began simultaneously in the cities of Nuln, Altdorf and Talabheim. The trade routes, the roads and rivers, helped the illness spread swiftly. Towns shut their gates against the many refugees. Middenheim closed its viaducts and avoided the Plague, but others did not. Entire villages were lost at once and soon the dead outnumbered the living. Bands of Flagellants wandered the land proclaiming Sigmar’s wrath.\\n\\nIn the spring, the Black Plague’s grip abated somewhat and the Council of Thirteen unleashed the Warlord clans. The tottering remnants of the Empire could not stand before the chittering hordes. The depopulated regions of the Empire were overrun. Defenders were slain and eaten, while crops and livestock were looted.\\n\\nAgainst the tolling bells of the infernal Skaven war machines, even walled towns were breached with ease. The Imperial Army was helpless against the onslaught. Only the largest of cities in the south – Altdorf, Nuln, and Averheim – were still standing, while the plague still ran rampant in the north.\\n\\nIn 1115, the incompetent Emperor Boris Goldgather fell to the plague. Ironically, the little-loved leader was one of the last human victims, the disease having run its course. Yet over three-quarters of the population was destroyed. Skaven armies marched openly across Reikland, Averland, Wissenland and Talabecland. The few surviving cities were now faced with starvation.\\n\\nOver the next seven years, the Skaven began systematically enslaving the human settlements. Swarms of Clanrats would surround a farm or village, set fire to it, and capture any who fled. Long, shuffling columns were led to slave-pits constructed amidst the ruins of Ubersreik and Pfeildorf in Wissenland. The fortunate worked above ground growing food for the ratmen, but most were sent below to the mines of the Under-Empire, doomed never to see the sun again.\\n\\nAs slaves and booty were stripped from the Empire, the status of Clan Pestilens rose. Even the other Lords of Decay, try as they might, could not deny the potency of the Black Plague. The Plague Lords pressed their advantage and supplanted two of the Lords of Decay. Thus Clan Pestilens secured an unprecedented (and worrisome) three positions on the Council of Thirteen.\\n\\nSkaven armies marched into the untouched province of Sylvania, searching for the meteors that were seen to land in that benighted land. To their dismay, the ratmen encountered plague-slain Zombies and packs of Ghouls. After several major battles for little gain, the Skaven withdrew from Sylvania to find easier prey.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_man_dread_skavenslayer_description	In 1118, Middenheim came under siege. The fortress-city atop the rock of Ulricsberg proved difficult to crack. Although Jezzail teams relentlessly picked off defenders from the walls and raiding parties infiltrated the sewers and broke into the city several times, all the Skaven advances were destroyed before they could be exploited.\\n\\nIt was the Elector Count Mandred who championed the defence, leading from atop the battlements or down in the labyrinth sewers, wherever the fighting was fiercest. Before the defenders could be worn down, disaster struck. The Skaven were struck with their own pestilence, their numbers rapidly dwindling. The ratmen established a hidden stronghold deep under Middenheim before withdrawing.\\n\\nThis was the turning point, for across the Empire the unbearable verminous multitudes transformed into a bedraggled mass. Mandred rallied the surviving Elector Counts and led the anti-Skaven crusade. As their own plague raged through their ranks, the ratmen were defeated in battle after battle.\\n\\nA Skaven counterattack, known as the Battle of the Howling Hills, was their last-ditch effort. The ploy almost worked until Mandred beheaded the Great Warlord Vrrmik of Clan Mors (a member of the Council of Thirteen). All Skaven hope of victory was lost. By 1124, the ratmen were driven below ground and Count Mandred Skaven Slayer, who wore Vrrmik’s skull on his helm, was proclaimed Emperor.\\n\\nThe Skaven were too depleted by disease and war to continue fighting. They had captured so many slaves during the campaign that the lords of Decay feared a revolt. So the Council decided to build up their strength before another assault, but it was not to be.\\n\\nOver the next 25 years, the man-things recovered more rapidly than the Lords of Decay thought possible. Under Emperor Mandred’s dynamic rule, towns were rebuilt, land was resettled, and refugees returned. Even worse, Mandred ordered a constant guard against ratmen, creating organisations such as the Sewer Watch to halt further incursions. In the Under-Empire, the predicted slave revolt did occur, along with further outbreaks of the Black Plague that destroyed entire clans (suspiciously, many thought).\\n\\nThe Council of Thirteen convened at Skavenblight and recriminations flew between the Plaguelords and the rest of the Council. There were many compensation demands from disease-ridden clans and many accusations of assassination attempts were levelled. Eventually, a decision was made to delay all further Empire operations, save for a single act of vengeance.\\n\\nA Clan Eshin Assassin broke into the palace and slew Emperor Mandred. False evidence of a mutant atrocity was left before the agent escaped into the sewers. To this day scholars fail to connect the Black Plague, the Skaven incursion, and the murder of the Emperor. As the years passed, the Skaven were dismissed as a threat to the Empire and within centuries what was known about the ratmen became so enshrouded in myth that many men now refuse to believe in their existence at all.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_the_red_pox_description	After the invasion of the Empire was repelled, the Plague Lords on the Council of Thirteen were outmanoeuvred and forced to adopt a different approach. In place of direct attack, the Lords of Decay chose to rebuild their strength while using Clan Eshin agents to bring anarchy through assassination and political manipulation.\\n\\nThe human crusades to Araby and the Tilean upheavals were examples of such campaigns instigated behind the scenes by nefarious plotting. Alas, no lasting victories were achieved using such insidious methods, and so it was that Clan Pestilens prevailed in persuading the Council to again attempt another invasion into the human realms.\\n\\nAiming to repeat the early success wrought upon the Empire, the Red Pox was delivered into the sewers of the Bretonnian city of Bordeleaux. The scourge slew a third of the population, but Baron Giscard Du’ponte ordered the poor quarter to be burnt. This act, for its deplorable lack of humanity, halted the contagion.\\n\\nThe full assault was launched a quarter of a century later and all of Bretonnia and northern Tilea blossomed with a virulent outbreak of Red Pox. Once again, the Council let the disease ravage and depopulate the region before signalling the Skaven armies to the surface.\\n\\nAt first nothing could stop the ravening hordes and many towns and villages were burned. The cities of Brionne and Quenelles were soon besieged. However, the combined forces of the Duc de Parravon and the Wood Elves of Athel Loren arrived in time to break the siege and soundly defeat the Skaven at the Battle of Remarche. And so another attempt to subjugate the man-things under the iron claw of Skaven rule ended in ignominy and paw-pointing.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_horned_rat_walks_among_us_description	As vast Chaos armies built up in the north, portents abounded – Morrslieb hung low and showers of meteors rained from the skies. The Grey Seers visited every Skaven stronghold up and down the Under-way. They gave a single ultimatum – be at the annual feast of Vermintide or suffer the wrath of the Great Horned Rat. The Grey Seers planned to invoke the Great Horned One himself in an effort to end the war between clans.\\n\\nSome clans feared a trap and so sent representatives, but none dared to stay away altogether. On the eve of Vermintide each lord or agent arrived in Skavenblight. For only the second time in their history a member of each clan gathered at the foot of the Temple of the Great Horned Rat.\\n\\nAn atmosphere of fearful expectation could be smelt upon the assembly as the temple doors swung open and the full order of 169 Grey Seers filed out. The Seerlord Kritislik was last of the thirteen thirteens and carried with him a great skin-bound book, which he set upon an iron lectern. As he squeaked, leading the incantation, the very air seemed to twist, and a distant ominous cracking could be heard. The Grey Seers picked up the chant and amplified the sound. The intensity rose as they began the sacrifices.\\n\\nOne by one, 169 slaves died in increasing agony, the last dying to the torments of the Seerlord himself. Their squeals of fear and pain reached out to the bowels of creation where the Horned Rat gnawed on the roots of reason. The Great Bell tolled as the brooding skies lashed chains of lightning to illuminate the scene. Again and again rang the unholy bell, so impossibly loud that it drowned out the sound of chanting and thunder alike. After the thirteenth toll the bell stopped, but its hellish reverberations could still be felt.\\n\\nIn the sudden quiet, the Seerlord opened his jaws and screeched, emitting a cloud of dark vapour that poured endlessly up until it plumed to the height of the tower itself. A great claw reached out and ripped the very curtain of reality. Now a shape, blacker than black, could be seen amidst the vapours. Two blood-red eyes as wide as castle gates stared out. As one the Skaven fell prostrate, pressing their muzzles to the dirt. Some dropped dead as their hearts burst.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_the_black_pillar_description	The silhouette of curving horns could be seen as the Horned Rat’s great claw reached out and leisurely scooped up a score of squealing Skaven. Yellow-fanged jaws flashed as the Great Horned Rat consumed them. The gaze of the Horned One swept over his quailing children and he reached out again and again.\\n\\nWhen the paw last withdrew, a glowing pillar of purest warpstone was revealed. It had 13 sides, each marked by 13 blocks of glowing runes. These runes contained the unholy verminous commandments of ruination and the dictates of rulership, along with prophecies of the Great Ascendancy.\\n\\nThen the Horned Rat whispered to the assembled horde with the voice of a million scratching and gnawing rats. He told them their wars amused him, but they must cease. The Skaven must spread corruption in order to inherit the world and assure his full return.\\n\\nHe demanded the reformation of the Council of Thirteen and promised that all must obey their commands or feel his wrath. Only his favoured could touch the pillar and thus only his chosen ones could join the Council. With that the awesome presence withdrew into the netherworld, the crack narrowing and sealing behind it.\\n\\nThe musk of fear hung heavy over the survivors as they blinked at the black pillar and reassured themselves that the Horned One had really been there and was really gone. Lord Rakin was the first to touch the pillar. He burned with black fire until only ashes remained.\\n\\nOver the long night no few relinquished their claims to the Council rather than face the test, but many more touched the pillar. Only twelve lived. Each of the Lords of Decay was imbued with an aura of dark power, truly the blessing of the Great Horned Rat. From that day, the Council of Thirteen has remained unchanged. Many Skaven have touched the pillar, some have survived, but none have defeated the existing Lords of Decay.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_war_beneath_world_description	The Skaven have fought with the Dwarf-things since their passageways first intersected each other deep underground. What the first Skaven thought when their crude picks broke into the ornately hewn Dwarfholds is not recorded, but the races have been at war ever since.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs of old established an everlasting realm, carved out of living rock and connected via the Ungdrin, their remarkable underground highway. This golden age of Dwarfs has long since ended, shattered in large part by the unrelenting attacks of the Skaven. Soon after unprecedented earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Skaven assaults began.\\n\\nThe first major hold to be lost was Karak Varn. With the lower levels already flooding, the hold came under attack by Night Goblins. The bearded-things were tenaciously holding their own until a new foe entered the fray. Using the element of complete surprise, the Skaven erupted from the lower mine workings. Dwarfs were used to fighting the sneaky Night Goblins, but the rapid-tunnelling numberless ratmen came as a nasty shock.\\n\\nIn the cramped underground corridors, the superior Skaven numbers could not be fully employed. Instead, frontal attacks swarmed hallways, literally crawling over each other to strike at the foe. In the meantime, other troops excavated new tunnels, seeking to burst behind or beneath the already sore-pressed defenders.\\n\\nThe Skaven timed their attacks to coincide with above ground assaults by Orcs and Goblins, often luring the Greenskins into attacking at the right place or time to aid the ratmen. Beset from above and below, the Dwarfs lost mine after mine, hold after hold.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_fall_karak_eight_peaks_description	Although forced to relinquish many settlements, no Dwarf ever imagined losing the glorious and powerful Eight Peaks – a city and stronghold with a vast network of mines. By the time Skaven tunnels were found deep underneath the lowest mine workings of Karak Eight Peaks, underground warfare had changed.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs were now fully aware of the Skaven and moved to counter each new threat. Sturdy resistance was no longer enough and invasions, even from below, were now met with countermines, well-conceived death traps and matchless Runesmith-produced arms and armour.\\n\\nWith typical Dwarfen precision, Miners gave way to gromril-encased Ironbreakers that steadfastly guarded the narrow points. The circuitous tunnels of the ratmen broke open to face firing lines of stalwart Dwarfs with handguns. A vast amount of Skaven blood was spent for every gain and yet around each new bend could be found another well-protected defence.\\n\\nIt was then that the embattled Warlord clans sought the guidance of the Council of Thirteen. The Council’s plan estimated ten generations before completion, but it guaranteed success. The first step was convincing local Orc tribes to stop fighting one another long enough to assault the Dwarfs on the surface.\\n\\nThe next step involved slowly poisoning Dwarf wells with warpstone. This took time to build up toxins slowly, but over the months the Dwarfs began to weaken, their bodies straining to fight the corruption. Giant Rats, purchased from Clan Moulder, could squirm through cracks to launch sudden attacks, but it was the weaponry of Clan Skryre that made the largest difference.\\n\\nThe powerful but portable Warpfire Thrower could melt gromril-reinforced gates, so it had no problems blasting the Dwarf shieldwalls that formed in front of such barriers. The bearded-things gave ground, but still grimly held on. It was then that the Warlock Engineers first deployed the poisoned wind, a deadly gas attack that proved highly lethal.\\n\\nNeither armour nor stoic determination could combat the fumes. Although still costly in terms of casualties, nothing could slow the inevitable Skaven advance. Level by level, hall by hall, the hold fell to the ratmen. Many Dwarfs, mighty warriors and unrivalled artisans alike, died agonising deaths in the pitch black beneath the world. After well over a century and a half of bitter and constant warfare, the last few hundred Dwarfs fled Karak Eight Peaks.\\n\\nIn the uppermost levels of the Dwarfhold and in the ruins of the abandoned city on the surface, the Skaven now battled the Orcs and Goblins that they themselves had first coerced into attacking.\\n\\nIn a climactic battle in ceremonial halls of the west quarter, Clan Mors collapsed the vaulted roof, sealing out the Greenskins from the desirable levels and simultaneously crushing several rival clans (who were not told of the plan). Shortly after, the Council of Thirteen approved the Clan Mors claim to make the City of Pillars their stronghold. And so it remains to this day.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_dwarf_realm_besieged_description	The fall of one of their largest and most prized settlements served notice that the Skaven were unlike the other threats to the Dwarfen realm. Although Orc tribes uniting to rampage or Chaos invasions were cataclysmic events, after such attacks the tide of war always receded and survivors had emerged.\\n\\nThe lengthy and systematic campaigns of the Skaven threatened to destroy each and every hold. There was no respite, nor an ebb to the endless numbers. Since losing Karak Eight Peaks there have been attacks under every major Dwarfhold.\\n\\nOnce deemed unassailable, even Karaz-a-Karak, the everlasting stronghold of strongholds, has been penetrated. Its lowest levels are now sealed with powerful runes and under constant guard, for the Dwarfs know what waits in the depths below.\\n\\nWherever the two races meet, the battle for domination continues. With each new tunnel invasion or bitterly contested counterattack, the underground warfare has continued to evolve. The Dwarfs, steadily pushed back from the narrow hallways, began defending the grand halls and caverns. Here vast armies formed up, daring the Skaven to mass and assault.\\n\\nThe Dwarfen shieldwall stretched unbroken for miles. The Skaven took the bait and only after suffering repeated massacres did the ratmen adapt once again. The efforts of dismantling and reassembling the larger engines of war such as a Screaming Bell or a Plague Furnace is arduous, but has proven devastating in the high arched halls of the Dwarfholds. To be a Dwarf in such times is to be besieged. Although many of that proud race still seek to reclaim their lost realm of old, many feel it is ambitious just to maintain their current strongholds.\\n\\nAnd so more of the Dwarf kingdom continues to be gnawed away. Karak Izril was plundered and its ruined halls left to the Greenskins. The mines of Grim-Duraz in the Grey Mountains were taken by Clan Morbidus, however the plagues unleashed there were so virulent that the caverns proved uninhabitable even after the swollen Dwarfs were removed. It is rumoured that Clan Pestilens have now secretively claimed the mines.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_rising_peril_description	After the summoning of the Great Horned Rat, the fractious clans, the Warlord and Greater clans alike, were far more willing to assent to the biddings of the Grey Seers. Indeed, now all seemed eager to be the first to bow and prostrate themselves under the authority of the Council of Thirteen.\\n\\nMany clans competed to supplicate themselves more than the others. Open warfare between clans almost disappeared and once again the Children of the Horned Rat began to work towards their true destiny – mastery of the world.\\n\\nThe always teeming population of the Skaven had been held in check for nearly five centuries by the civil war. To grow again, the Lords of Decay looked to stop the clans from endlessly enslaving each other and instead, turn their beady eyes to other lands.\\n\\nCoordinated by the Grey Seers, a number of towns and villages that bordered the Blighted Marshes began to disappear. Some of the human settlements were left in burnt ruins, others ravaged by foul and mysterious plagues that struck suddenly and left no survivors. In some cases a town might be plucked clean of citizens, but left otherwise unmolested.\\n\\nThese strange ‘ghost towns’ were a wonder to travellers and caused much rumour and speculation, but not nearly as much as the great holes. A few villages were simply consumed, swallowed whole by miles-wide sinkholes.

The horned mage-rats bore special orders from the Council of Thirteen and went in person to coerce the plans and schemes into action. The largest lair-nests along the Under-way became the launching sites of new offensives.\\n\\nThe Warlord clans of Foul Peak and Fester Spike all but ceased their feuding in order to combine their forces and overpower the many tribes of Night Goblins that had taken abode in the caves riddling the Vaults. Clan Pestilens, supported by Clan Septik, led the attacks out of Putrid Swamp that took many prisoners from the villages of Wissenland, in the southern part of the Empire.\\n\\nMany successes were boastfully reported to the capital before the pestilent host was driven back underground by a large army that marched out of Nuln. The Council’s orders had been specific – scavenge along the edges, but that was all. The time was not ripe for full-scale assault.\\n\\nFrom the Black Chasm and other lesser strongholds many attacks were levelled at small towns on both the Imperial and the Bretonnian side of the Grey Mountains as the Council hoped to drive a spike between the alliance of those two great nations.\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_attack_on_nuln_description	After long years of building up strength underneath cities of the Empire, the Skaven once again brought full-scale war to Imperial lands. A campaign of manipulation and bribery culminated in open war in Nuln. It had long ago been discovered that man-things could be bribed or blackmailed into aiding the Skaven.\\n\\nMany key individuals, the most important of which was the Chief Magistrate of Nuln, had been involved in a Skaven scheme that hoped to spark another civil war the Empire. Unfortunate interference led to the plot’s untimely unravelling and, in an impetuous rage, a vengeance-attack was launched against the city.\\n\\nGrey Seer Thanquol masterminded the Skaven battle plan, which included troops from the four Greater clans and several Warlord clans. The attackers infiltrated through the sewers and succeeded in destroying close to half the city. Clanrats emerged in a nigh-unstoppable surge, packs of savage Rat Ogres rampaged through the cobblestone streets and Stormvermin almost captured the Countess Emmanuelle.\\n\\nSeveral of the Council of Thirteen were furious with the attack, feeling it was launched prematurely to the Great Plan. Many more were upset with the attack’s ultimate failure. Seerlord Kritislik was quick to point out that during the action a rebellious Warlord clan was all but eradicated.\\n\\nThe attack also showed that the veil of secrecy was having some effect over the lands of the Empire. Despite a proportion of the city in smoking ruin and many casualties, the majority of the population still refused believe that Skaven existed. Even Imperial soldiers who fought the ratmen in close quarters were persuaded that it was a mutant uprising or another Beastmen attack. By retrieving their dead and other cover-up actions by Clan Eshin, the Skaven ensured they remain a shadowy threat to all but the keenest of minds.\\n	false

Far from the light of the world, the clans were all growing in strength and power.\\n \\nThe Dwarfs were dying; the cold-blooded things were no threat, having been almost beaten once by just a single clan. The Skaven held the green-things in too much contempt to give them any concern.\\n\\nThe lands of the man-things were riddled beneath with a growing horde of verminkin awaiting the orders to attack. The man-beasts were unworthy of attention. The men of the north that worshipped the Dark Gods were fearsome, but the Council knew how to deal with their kind. Who then would dare to stand before the Great Ascension?\\n\\nBut Lord Verminkin, the Packlord of Clan Moulder and he-who-is-eleventh accused Clan Eshin and the rest of the Council of cowardice and avoidance against the Elf-things. The Nightlord of Clan Eshin, Lord Sneek, spoke, his reedy whisper-squeak menacing and cold.\\n\\nHe spoke of failures that were not the fault of his clan. He told of the inability to penetrate magical defences, of creatures that could feel the presence of Clan Eshin’s best. He spoke of run-ins at trading ports and in the Far East. He spoke of a lone sea-fortress on the southern tip of Cathay. With the right support, perhaps it would be best to start there, far from the Elf-thing's power base?\\n	false

gen_lore_skv_battle_gates_calith_description	So it was that the Council ordered many Skaven to begin the long trek to the far side of the world. Gutter Runners led no less than seven Warlord clans through winding and seldom-used passageways far past the Dark Lands. The Lords of Decay commissioned a new Skaven fleet and the rotting dockyards of the Spineport heaved with toiling slaves.\\n\\nIt took years to plan, scout out, and build up a large enough force, but at long last the High Elf fortress at the Gates of Calith was attacked from both land and sea. Issuing out of tunnels, a seething mass of Skaven advanced on a wide front towards the indomitable Elven fortress.\\n\\nThe Skaven were led by the Grey Seer Lurkwoal, mounted atop a Screaming Bell, which was already causing the walls to splinter and crack. The ramshackle fleet included perhaps half of the Skaven’s total vessels, and many of the ships housed complex machineries of destruction on their superstructures.\\n\\nFor their part, the High Elf garrison guarding the Gates of Calith were totally surprised – but they were highly trained warriors far from their home, and well-used to the lightning raids of their own twisted kin. They had been caught unawares, but not unprepared. To an Elf, they defended the walls. Their fleet, not waiting to be blockaded and besieged, sailed out from under arched gates to meet the foe upon the seas.\\n\\nThe fortress walls were breached and through these gaps Lurkwoal ordered his Hell Pit Abominations. The lurching horrors had caused untold casualties and eaten many slaves on the long trip through the Under-way, but now they were unleashed in their fury.\\n\\nMighty fists swept the Elf-things aside and the mutated beasts crushed many more underneath their formidable bulk. Despite the hail of arrows that rained from the battlements, thousands of Clanrat warriors followed through the gaping holes. There they were pitted against the steel-eyed martial prowess of the Elves.\\n\\nFew creatures can rival a Skaven for speed, but the Elf-things were not found wanting. Locking shields, a thin white line of warriors advanced to hold the swarming Skaven from the final gates guarding the innermost fortress. It was then that disaster struck the verminous host.\\n\\nThe Elf fleet, having sunk the entirety of its ramshackle adversary, returned to pour broadsides of boltfire into the massing Skaven. The last Abomination fell twitching spasmodically to the ground. The Skaven, so close to a victorious feast, instead began to melt away, wavering and breaking from the storm of bolts and arrows piercing their ranks.\\n\\nThe resolute Elven Spearmen charged, and Grey Seer Lurkwoal only escaped thanks to the timely resurrection of a Hell Pit Abomination, which staggered back up, roared with a thousand voices, and crashed into the rear of the High Elves. Only a trail of splintered gear and dead was left behind.\\n\\nAlthough the message was broken up by static interference, Lurkwoal reported by Farsqueaker his ‘near success’ to the disappointed Council before beginning the long trek home to Skavenblight.\\n	false

This is the home of the Chaos Gods.[[/i]]\\n\\nIn the Realm of Chaos there are no physical laws akin to those that dominate the mortal world. Within its confines dreams become real, and reality is reborn as fevered hallucination. Gravity, shape, space and reason – all are in flux, utterly mutable to the will of the Chaos Gods.\\n\\nFew mortals are capable of perceiving the Realm of Chaos in its true splendour, for the living mind recoils from such otherworldly landscapes. For this reason, no two visions of the Realm of Chaos are alike, as the mind attempts to hide the impossible with fragments stolen from memory. The Realm of Chaos is a place of dreams and nightmares, where cause need not follow effect, and within its bounds anything is possible.\\n\\nThe Dark Gods of Chaos each have their own particular spheres of influence, their own daemonic servants, and their own sub-dimensional territories in the Realm of Chaos.

The brothers in darkness are constantly at war with one another, vying for power amid the immaterial planes. Despite their myriad differences, the Great Gods of Chaos share a common goal: total domination of all that is. Such absolute power cannot be shared, even amongst Gods.\\n\\nDaemonic armies clash across crystal plains, venomous forests, bone-choked swampland and rivers of churning gore, pursuing vast wars of attrition as the Chaos Gods claim and counter-claim territory and the magical lifeblood that goes with it. In the Realm of Chaos, where magic is the stuff of being, the breadth of a domain is not merely a symbol of power, it is indeed power itself.\\n\\nAs the minions of one God seize advantage, that territory is moulded to the whims and hubris of its new master, sloughing off its old form to reveal a new countenance. If Khorne’s bloody minions overrun a portion of Nurgle’s festering garden, the diseased foliage swiftly decays down to nothing, leaving only barren and ruddy wasteland. Similarly, should Tzeentch manage to wrest that same territory from Khorne, iridescent crystalline structures consume the parched firmament.\\n\\nAlliances in this eternal war are complex, but far from unknown – in fact, the Dark Gods often seek advantage through common cause. Though Khorne is the greatest of all the Chaos Gods, he is not all-powerful. Tzeentch is his closest rival, but if the circumstances are right then Nurgle – and sometimes Slaanesh – can rise to be his equal or eclipse him entirely.\\n\\nAs if this were not complicated enough, there are deep-seated rivalries amongst the Gods that can further influence matters. Khorne most despises Slaanesh, whose dark designs are an affront to the Blood God’s sense of honour and martial pride. Similarly, Tzeentch and Nurgle – respectively the manifestations of hope and despair – need little spurring to come to blows.\\n\\nEach God strives for dominance over the others, and though one may gain ascendancy for a while, no God has yet succeeded in vanquishing another. As one God gains mastery the others combine against him, and as the allies grow in power they divide, forming new pacts of necessity until another conqueror emerges to be vanquished in his turn.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_blood_gods_domain_description	The largest of the kingdoms in the Realm of Chaos is that of Khorne, the God of battle. No subtlety has Khorne. He has no yearning for beauty of form in his black heart, for he is the Blood God, the Skulltaker.\\n\\nWithin his immortal frame there is room for rage alone, and slaughter is his only desire. So it is that Khorne’s realm is shaped to his personality, as indeed are all the domains of the Gods crafted to their idiosyncratic nature. The land of the Blood God is one of constant battle and martial challenge. It serves no other function.\\n\\nKhorne’s dominion is little more than leagues upon leagues of blasted wasteland, made ruddy by the blood spilt upon it. Here and there jagged canyons and craters break the uneven ground: the aftermath of a titanic clash of might where the Blood God’s daemonic servants battled amongst themselves or against the minions of another deity. Such battles are nigh endless.\\n\\nIf one of Khorne’s brother Gods does not wish to strive against the Blood God’s followers, the Blood God’s minions battle amongst themselves. On rare occasions, Khorne will bring mortal champions to this place and test their fighting skills against his Daemons. Few such contests end in victory for the mortal, but those fleshlings who endure find their feet set upon the path to daemonhood, whether it is their wish or no.\\n\\nThe very fabric of Khorne’s kingdom is tied to his mood which, while never good, ranges between simmering rage and epoch-ending fury. The ground tremors and shakes as the Blood God’s thunderous bellows echo throughout eternity. Lakes of blood boil, and the very sky screams.\\n\\nClouds of choking black ash belch forth from hidden geysers, incinerating milling combatants or propelling great boulders into the sky, only for them to smash back into the ground with crushing force. Yet still the Daemons battle. They fight not for honour, not for wealth, not even for victory – they fight for fighting’s sake, and for the favour of their wrathful lord.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_skull_throne_description	Towering over the ageless desolation of Khorne’s realm is the Blood God’s brass citadel. The walls of this unholy bastion are jagged, thick with crusted blood and ichor, with gibbets and gallows displaying the lifeless remains of assailants.\\n\\nThe moat of the brass citadel is filled not with water, but with the boiling blood of Khorne’s victims across space and time. Iron gargoyles snarl from every parapet, daemonic hatred in their eyes and molten metal in their bellies, while Flesh Hounds prowl the space between the outer walls and the keep, gnawing at ancient bones and longing for fresh meat.\\n\\nKhorne himself dwells within a great vault at the black heart of the citadel’s central keep. Eight iron pillars vanish into the ebon gloom to shoulder the inconceivable weight of the throne room’s ceiling. Each pillar is inscribed with one of the commandments of Khorne. These edicts speak to the unholy virtues of rage, martial skill and defiance.\\n\\nIn the centre of the room the Blood God sits upon a mighty throne of brass atop a vast mountain of skulls, each the grisly trophy of a champion victorious, or the remains of a champion defeated. Khorne is customarily clad in ornate armour of black and brass.\\n\\nThe Blood God’s body is broad and muscular, his visage that of a fierce and snarling dog with ravaged lips. When Khorne speaks, he does so in bellows of black rage – each guttural syllable igniting the air in tainted sparks.\\n\\nUpon Khorne’s fingers are many brass rings, some blazoned with his own skull rune. Upon others are mounted the severed heads of lesser Gods, or less fatal tokens of vanquished foes. What being would dare face the Blood God in the arena of martial prowess remains a mystery, so the provenance of these other rings is unknown, lest they be tokens from the great battle from which creation sprang.\\n\\nAt Khorne’s side is a mighty double-handed sword. Legend tells that the drawing of this dolorous weapon is the harbinger of calamity, and that Khorne could split existence asunder with but a single stroke were it his desire. Elsewhere in the citadel, mighty armouries are stocked with every weapon imaginable, yet for reasons long since forgotten to mortals, Khorne always favours this one sword.\\n\\nAt the foot of the throne, a carpet of splintered bone extends in all directions, the remains of those slain by the Blood God’s conquering champions. Under the stygian shadow of the chamber’s eaves lies a mighty anvil, where furnace-daemons forge weapons and armour for the Blood God’s favoured followers – great warriors and mighty war leaders who kill for that which they desire. Here also lurks the great Hound Karanak, a massive, three-headed Daemon-beast who prowls the cavernous throne room.\\n\\nIn the very direst of need, when his armies are overwhelmed and his citadel beset, Khorne rises from his throne, his armoured footfalls shaking the Realm of Chaos to its core. With an honour guard of Bloodthirsters, each with the power of an army in its own right, the Lord of Battle unleashes his rage upon the foe, scattering the Daemons of his rivals with each sweep of his mighty blade and trampling their broken bodies underfoot.\\n\\nThis willingness to take physical participation in the Great Game is what marks Khorne out from his fellow Gods. Even so, such personal interventions are rare indeed, and so each calamitous occasion marks a turning of the tide in the wars of the Gods.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_realm_of_sorcerer_description	Almost as great in scale as Khorne’s domain is the crystal labyrinth of Tzeentch, an immense iridescent plateau whose gaudy brilliance sits in stark contrast to the Blood God’s ruddy wasteland. Whilst the crystal labyrinth is not so massive as Khorne’s kingdom, it dominates the Realm of Chaos no less – though it does so in its own fashion.\\n\\nCountless glittering pathways spring from the very heart of the labyrinth, fractal filaments that inveigle their way into the dominions of other Gods and so bind the Realm of Chaos together. It is Tzeentch who holds the Realm of Chaos beyond the material universe, and it is the Great Sorcerer’s glittering domain that allows him to do so. If ever the crystal labyrinth were to be destroyed, the Realm of Chaos would lose all cohesion shortly after.\\n\\nNo Daemons guard the crystal labyrinth, yet a journey through its canyons and caverns remains a perilous one. Only those with the strongest of wills can negotiate its corridors, for the crystal labyrinth’s walls reflect not only light, but also hopes, despair, dreams and terror.\\n\\nAs if this were not challenge enough, there is no fixed path through this maze, merely a constantly changing series of obstacles and traps created by Tzeentch’s unconscious mind. Those trammelled by the labyrinth come to no physical harm, yet none can escape these hallowed halls of infinite possibility with their sanity intact. At every step the air is thick with broken dreams, and everywhere the light sparkles with fragments of shattered personality.\\n\\nOnly a direct attack upon the crystal labyrinth can rouse Tzeentch from his introspection, for much of his knowledge is stored within its arcane lattice – indeed, some such knowledge is said to be so old that Tzeentch is the only being in all of creation that yet remembers it. Nevertheless, the Hidden Library is never quiet nor still, though there is about it a certain ethereal tranquillity.\\n\\nAs the Great Conspirator contemplates infinity, feathered Lords of Change bind spells and magical utterances of all kinds within fiery tomes. Elsewhere, Pink Horrors scuttle to sculpt the Impossible Fortress, using their magics to reinforce or redirect its structure, all awaiting the next phase of Tzeentch’s great plan.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_impossible_fortress_description	At the heart of the labyrinth, safe from all save those whose insanity has given them insight into its nature, is the Impossible Fortress of Tzeentch. As with all of Tzeentch’s designs, the exact appearance of the Impossible Fortress varies according to the nature of the beholder’s aspirations.\\n\\nSome perceive it to be crafted from the same crystal as the labyrinth, whilst others see walls of blue flame or gnarled azure stone. No matter the material, the physical structure of the Impossible Fortress is in constant flux. Spires and towers constantly writhe and burst forth from the fortress’ heart, only to collapse and be reabsorbed.\\n\\nGateways, windows and other portals appear in the eldritch building’s flanks, only to fold inwards seconds later. There is no discernible pattern to this behaviour, for the writhing shape of the Impossible Fortress is somehow bound to the state of Tzeentch’s current schemes and there is no predicting such complexity.\\n\\nThe innards of the Impossible Fortress are no less confounding than the exterior. Different passages and rooms obey different physical laws, or may exist in other physical dimensions. That which is decreed by gravity to be ‘up’ in one chamber may be ‘down’ in another; or can indeed be an alternate state of being entirely, such as sorrow or the past.\\n\\nWere a mortal to find himself in the Impossible Fortress he would not live long before being driven completely insane – but then, what else is to be expected in a place where a man can travel backwards in time by walking across a room? Those who succumb to the warping nature of Tzeentch’s palace collapse utterly in an implosion of consciousness and form. Such creatures are reborn as sorcerous familiars and given as gifts to Tzeentch’s champions in the mortal world.\\n\\nEven Daemons cannot easily endure the twisted horror of the Impossible Fortress – only the Lords of Change can safely navigate its corridors. As a result, no matter how distracted Tzeentch may be by the Great Game, he is never assailed in his stronghold. The other Gods have lost too many minions just trying to get beyond the first perplexing room, and invaders must negotiate a hundred or more of such chambers to come before the Hidden Library and the great God Tzeentch himself.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_riddle_mortal_world_description	Occupied as he is with weighty schemes, the Great Sorcerer is not inclined to any form of undue motion – he has minions to attend to such minor concerns. Tzeentch can pass countless centuries at a time seated in a sea of swirling, multicoloured mist, scrying the Well of Eternity’s abyssal depths and examining every flicker in its shimmering surface for clues to events that have yet to pass. Much of his attention is focused upon the mortal world, for of all the Chaos Gods, it is Tzeentch who is the most fascinated by this other realm.\\n\\nIn Tzeentch’s eyes, mortal creatures are immeasurably steeped in deceit and ambiguity, yet somehow live their daily lives practically unaware of the countless contradictions and blemishes in their souls. To the Great Conspirator, such a playground presents an irresistible lure and challenge.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, Tzeentch cannot help but dabble in the mortal realm, sometimes as part of the Great Game against his brother Gods, but more often to satisfy his own instinctive urge to meddle, manipulate and control. It is quite possible that the Great Conspirator is completely and utterly mad, conjuring schemes that are self-defeating in worlds and dreamscapes only he can perceive. This is the most horrifying truth of all, for if Tzeentch is mad, then what is the mortal world save for an expression of his insanity!\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_land_of_plaguelord_description	On the border of Tzeentch’s realm is the domain of Nurgle, the Great Lord of Decay who presides over physical corruption and morbidity. Nurgle can truly be called the father of all pestilence, for his immense frame is home to every disease known to mortals.\\n\\nHis gigantic body is bloated with corruption and exudes an overpowering stench. His skin is greenish, leathery and necrotic, its surface pock-marked with running sores, swelling boils and numerous signs of infestation.\\n\\nNurgle’s inner organs, rank with excremental decay, spill through the ruptured skin to hang like obscene fruit around his girth. From these organs burst tiny Daemons which chew on the rotting bowels and suck upon the nauseous juices within. Such is the appearance of the Chaos God Nurgle – though mere words can barely do justice to his truly impressive foulness.\\n\\nAlthough Nurgle is ranked behind Khorne and Tzeentch, the truth is that his power is not necessarily weaker, just less stable than that of the other Gods. When Nurgle unleashes his ghastly pestilences his power rises to a peak.\\n\\nLike a plague, his power grows and may reach pandemic proportions, temporarily overshadowing that of all the other Gods put together. It is for this reason that Nurgle commands a wary respect from all of his brother Gods. Though Nurgle’s daemonic legions may not be as ferocious as those of Khorne, nor as numerous as those of Tzeentch, when Nurgle’s power waxes even Daemons can fall prey to his repertoire of grisly afflictions.\\n\\nNurgle’s great delight is in the cycle of existence, in life and death. At the heart of his mouldering mansion, he indulges his passion. Beneath mildewed and sagging beams, the great God labours for untold hours at an iron cauldron, a receptacle vast enough to contain all the oceans of the world.\\n\\nNurgle works to create contagion and pestilence – the simplest, yet most fecund, forms of life. Such is the ghastly irony of Nurgle’s existence: everything he does is with the goal of bringing more life into the world, yet so many of his creations are inimical to other beings that Nurgle is widely thought of as a destroyer, not a creator.\\n\\nWith every stir of Nurgle’s maggot-ridden ladle, a dozen fresh diseases flourish. From time to time, Nurgle ceases his stirring, and reaches down with a leathery hand to scoop a portion of the ghastly mixture into his cavernous mouth and taste the fruits of his labour.\\n\\nShould the putrid soup meet with approval, the God waddles to the corner of his workshop, where he holds Poxfulcrum, a Daemon blessed with the ability to heal infections, but afflicted with a vulnerability to them all. Opening the corroded cage, Nurgle forces her to imbibe the putrid mixture, watching with ill-concealed excitement for the signs and symptoms of his latest creation.\\n\\nThough Poxfulcrum inevitably purges the disease from her body, the efficacy with which she does so allows the Plaguelord to evaluate his creations. If Nurgle is pleased, he returns to his cauldron – as he empties it into the grate below, the teeming liquid falls as rain upon the mortal world.\\n\\nIf the concoction does not meet with Nurgle’s approval, he begins to prepare his soup anew. As for Poxfulcrum, she whispers to mortals while the Plaguefather is busy at his cauldron, apprising them of cures for the ailments Nurgle unleashes upon the world.\\n\\nSo has she entered the beliefs of a thousand cultures under a thousand names. Some mortals believe her to be Nurgle’s daughter, who cures only so that new diseases can take hold, while others see her as Nurgle’s bitter foe, a deity of healing and patron of the afflicted.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_garden_blight_description	Pestilence is not Nurgle’s sole obsession. When not labouring at his iron cauldron, Nurgle cultivates his garden with a tenderness and pride utterly at odds with his rank and loathsome appearance. As with all worldly things within the Realm of Chaos, Nurgle’s overgrown garden is of a scale large enough to befuddle the mind.\\n\\nWithin its bounds are the plants and trees drawn from a thousand worlds across a hundred realities. Bright sprays of red, blue, yellow and purple puncture the autumnal gloom; havens of splendid cheeriness in a dismal woodscape. Each strain of flora flourishes in its peculiar environment, though not all are immediately recognisable. Like any gardener, Nurgle cannot resist the recombining of his beloved strains.\\n\\nAlmost everything in the Plaguefather’s garden is some strange hybrid of vegetable, fungoid and daemonic life. Perhaps as a result of this, the garden is alive with a kind of ghastly intelligence. It is not sentient, as such, but has enough carnivorous instinct and drive to attack intruders, its plague-smothered vines bestowing all manner of deathly poxes on those who foolishly come within reach.\\n\\nAs Nurgle’s power grows, so too does the splendour of his garden. At the zenith of the Plaguelord’s power, the undergrowth becomes vital enough to burst over its boundaries and cast murky tendrils onto Tzeentch’s crystal labyrinth. Left unchecked, the decaying presence of Nurgle’s plants crack and weather the arcane geodes from which the labyrinth is composed.\\n\\nSuch an assault, however unwitting, inevitably provokes Tzeentch’s minions to instinctively attack the incursive foliage, using sorcerous fire to scour root, stem and branch from the shimmering labyrinth. This in turn rouses the wrath of Father Nurgle. Before long, the daemonic servants of the Great Sorcerer and the Plaguelord are at war once again. Such battles can last seconds or centuries, for they only cease when Nurgle’s power – and thus the unchecked growth of his garden – recedes again.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_dark_prince_realms_description	Slaanesh’s realm is the smallest corner of the infernal regions, for he is the youngest of the Chaos Gods, and as yet his power is much overshadowed by his brothers. It is no coincidence that a narrow isthmus separates Slaanesh’s domain from the rest of the Realm of Chaos. The power of the Dark Prince is but a fraction of the other Chaos Gods, and he seeks whatever advantage he can – including that of defensive position.\\n\\nThe Dark Prince’s realm is divided into six different domains, arranged in concentric rings around Slaanesh’s Palace of Pleasure. Slaanesh’s domain is commonly thought a paradise by the mortal souls lured here, but nothing is precisely what it seems.\\n\\nEach region is formed around one of the six deadly seductions of Slaanesh: Avidity, Gluttony, Carnality, Paramountcy, Vainglory and Indolency. These circles are not only a continuous celebration of Slaanesh’s needs and desires, but also his chief defence.\\n\\nAn intruder must pass through each of the six circles in turn before reaching the heart of Slaanesh’s domain – an act of will that few souls, mortal or daemonic, can perform. As one moves from circle to circle, the desire to succumb becomes increasingly overwhelming.\\n\\nOnce mortals have sampled the pleasures of Slaanesh’s realm, they cannot stop; compelled towards excess, they think nothing of the consequences – only of the pleasure that indulgence brings. Some, much too late, discover the trap that has been set for them, but this matters not to Slaanesh, who finds moans of ecstasy or cries of horror equally satisfactory, providing they are heartfelt.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_six_circles_seduction_description	The circle of Avidity forms the outermost boundary of Slaanesh’s domain. The temptations within its borders seek to awaken an interloper’s sense of greed. Gold is here, ingots and coins beyond counting. Precious stones are sunk deep into every wall, and gilded sculptures line every path.\\n\\nAll who attempt to seize this wealth are doomed. The gemstones hatch daemonic birthlings that burrow beneath the skin to eat their victim from inside to out, ever after wearing the stolen form as a trophy. To lay but a finger upon Slaanesh’s statuary is to join it, with consciousness rendered immortal, but trapped in an immobile golden body for all time.\\n\\nShould greed not ensnare, then the next circle is that of Gluttony, with sumptuous banquets and rivers of wine. A single taste reduces the imbiber to a bloated fool whose only desire is to gorge until his tortured body gives way under the strain.\\n\\nBeyond the circle of Gluttony lies that of Carnality. a debauched place where all manner of fleshly pleasures may be sampled. Lissom maidens walk the verdant fields, their face and form seemingly sprung from heart’s dearest desire. Yet to tryst with such a creature is purest folly, for there are clawed hands and serpent’s teeth beneath the glamour, and an appetite for fleshly pleasures of a different sort.\\n\\nUpon entering the next circle, the traveller is greeted by the roar of an adulating crowd, for this is the circle of Paramountcy, where intruders are tempted with power and all its application. Armies, their numbers so great as to blacken the plains, greet those of martial bent, whilst the politically minded are also met in kind, with nations to guide and people to rule.\\n\\nFor any traveller with a desire for personal power within his heart, this is a paradise of sorts for a time, a place where every whim is obeyed, and every command fulfilled. Yet to tarry within this circle is to be overcome with paranoia, to see a dagger beneath every smile and poison in every chalice – the cheering throng becomes a tortuous and inescapable prison.\\n\\nThe circle of Vainglory is a garden, its maze of paths thick with beautiful flowers and heavy with thorns. Here, unseen voices whisper reminders of past glories, of achievements great and small. Most deadly of all is the remembrance of circles conquered and unheeded temptations.\\n\\nEach step an intruder takes with pride in his heart leads him further from his path, drawing him deeper and deeper into the choked undergrowth. There he swiftly falls prey to the tearing briars and roots, whilst the chanting thorn-children of the garden weave his every failure into a mocking epitaph.\\n\\nLast, and most dangerous, is the circle of Indolency, a serene domain of heavenly choirs and perfumed seas. All within this circle, whether root and branch or stock and stone, works to lull the mind and senses.\\n\\nA single draft of the ambrosial waters can rob a mortal of purpose and will. To sleep here is to never again awaken. The lone and level sands that crunch underfoot are the desiccated husks of all those who have succumbed, and the ethereal voices are their souls in torment. If this final and most insidious of circles is traversed, then a traveller can finally ascend to the seat of Slaanesh’s power.\\n\\nSlaanesh does not have a stronghold as such, merely a luxurious palace wherein his daemonic followers pay court to their master. This shimmering alcazar haunts the dreams and nightmares of mortals in a way that no other place can. It is said that contests in every manner of excess are to be found within the palace and its fleshy walls pulse to the rhythms within.\\n\\nThese debauched competitions occur in six great halls, each cavernous chamber devoted to one of the six deadly seductions of Slaanesh. Such are the incredible depths to which these earthly sins are pursued that their practitioners pass beyond pleasure into torments so terrible that only the truest devotees of Slaanesh can take joy in them.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_daemonic_incursions_description	Daemons can only exist in the mortal world if magically sustained, and even then are vulnerable to the inevitable ebb and flow of arcane energy. As such, they can only enter the mortal world in regions saturated with magic, where the influence of Chaos waxes strongest.\\n\\nMost significant of these is the Chaos gateway in the frozen north, where the abode of man and the domain of the Gods are conjoined. As this portal expands, it draws the northern territories into the Realm of Chaos and spews Daemons into mortal lands. Though this is by far the largest breach, there are many other weak points scattered across the known world, legacies of reckless magic through which the Daemons bring ruin and death.\\n\\nDaemonic invasions are seldom motivated by territory or plunder – for the minions of the Dark Gods have no desire for material wealth. Instead wars are waged as a key part in some divine strategy. Tzeentch, the Great Schemer, sends his minions into the mortal plane to further his ineffable plans, while Nurgle, Lord of Decay, does so to encourage the growth of his beloved poxes and pestilences. Such invasions rarely last long, for these rifts can only sustain Daemons for a short time, but always leave desolation in their wake.\\n\\nAs terrifying as these incursions are, they are nothing as to what would occur should the Winds of Magic grow strong enough to allow Daemons to walk the world at will. On that day, the Daemons of the Chaos Gods shall enter the mortal plane in triumph, and the world will end in madness and death.\\n	false

It now seemed to me that the stench of death broke my fall, and I flew onwards towards fresh visions of despair.\\n\\nAnd then ahead I saw a stair, surrounded by pinnacles and columns and arches of blood and carven bone, circled by Daemons bound within black iron, brazen steps and hideous shrieking mouths. All that could speak or gibber vomited forth the praises of Khorne and shrieked out songs of death.\\n\\nThe stair, its treads never built for mortal feet, climbed the dizzy heights, pausing at times before profane runes and stained sacrifice stones. Within the very fabric of the Daemon-thronged bastion were smaller landings, each of which could have held a lofty and noble palace of our small world. The stair twisted and rippled on itself, its Daemons snarling their insane glee at its dreadful geometry. Still it climbed, ever upwards into the clouds of gore that circled overhead.\\n\\nI beheld the wastelands of Khorne beyond the bastion, soaked red with blood and stained with souls. All about, the Daemons battled one another, unheeding of fear or pain.

Like an animal stuffed and mounted under glass, or a fish salted in a barrel, it had been preserved and pickled by the whim of Chaos. Cast aside and left to wander across the heavens, all was still and desolate in that place.\\n\\nThe castle’s towers no longer knew the sounds of men, its halls held no lofty nobles. Its gates admitted no tenantry, no sentinel stood guard and no porter waited by the gate.

I knew beyond doubt that it had stood for years uncounting in that same ramshackle form, and would continue on until the very end of time.\\n\\nBefore the fortress gates stretched a forest of death. Corpses, thick with unbridled decay, lay about it as far as my eyes could see. Here death was feeding off the dead. This was the Garden of Chaos. Vile creatures nested amongst the bones of the dead, there to gnaw at the fallen and fill the air with sickly sound of merriment.\\n\\nHere dark trees had petrified, their shapes indescribable and their essence corrupt. The graves of the fallen had become a rich loam, sucked upon by the trees of that dark forest.

It was they too who brought the curse of Chaos down upon the world, for there were entities that even the Old Ones could not command.\\n\\nFor reasons long since lost to history, the Old Ones' great polar gates – the means by which they traversed the stars – collapsed; torn asunder in an explosion of raw power that shook the world to its foundation. Fragments of the gate were flung across the landscape as incandescent comets that struck the ground with enough force to level mountains and shatter continents.\\n\\nThe poles of the world collapsed upon themselves, opening rifts into the raw ether of the Realm of Chaos. Huge amounts of chaotic material coalesced into matter in the form of a new and malignant moon.\\n\\nAs the skies burned and the earth quaked, the primal fears of a billion cowering souls took on unholy vigour. Borne forth from this maelstrom of emotion were the Dark Gods of Chaos. From the shadowy Realm of Chaos they looked upon the mortal realm with hunger – for the destruction of the warp gates marked not only the birth of the Chaos Gods but also the departure of the Old Ones.\\n\\nNo one, not even the wisest of the Slann, truly knows what happened to these supreme beings. Some believe the Old Ones were destroyed or possessed by the influx of chaotic energy, while others speculate that they deemed the world lost and so abandoned it to its fate. Departed, corrupted or destroyed, the Old Ones were gone; the fledgling races of the world were abandoned and alone before the diabolical desires of the Dark Gods.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_the_summoning_description	Over the centuries, mortals of all races have summoned Daemons. They do so to further their own goals, using knowledge gleaned from heretical texts such as the Grimoire Daemonicus, the Pandemonius and the Liber Malefic.\\n\\nSome seek a powerful protector, or an unstoppable assassin to slay their enemies. Others yearn for knowledge of magic, or even insight into future events. As creatures that dwell outside of time, Daemons have a unique perspective on the real world and can prophesy far into a mortal’s distant future.\\n\\nFor their part, Daemons are only too eager to ride a summoning’s magic back to its source – though without any intention of showing gratitude to the one who opened the door. This is when the summoner discovers just how strong his spells of protection are.\\n\\nAny whose wards are in the slightest way insufficient are swiftly devoured, their magical skills and essence sacrificed to allow the Daemon to survive in the real world. Should the summoner prove to be protected by enchantments of a complexity and power that the Daemon cannot break, he can then assert a measure of influence over the creature.\\n\\nEven a bound Daemon is a most dangerous servant, ever seeking to throw off its bonds. Any advice and wisdom it imparts are always to further its diabolic bid for freedom, although inevitably couched in terms that seem beneficial to the summoner.\\n\\nThe most cunning beasts lure their gaoler into agreement, where the Daemon pledges itself to a period of service. Such a pact can last for days, years or even centuries. yet all end the same way: the Daemon emerges triumphant and the mortal ends up devoured by his captive.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_the_dark_moon_description	The dark moon Morrslieb is full only one night a year, when its orbit brings it closest to the world. This night is known by many names: Geheimnisnacht to the Empire and Winter’s Eve in Bretonnia, it is Twilight’s Tide to the Elves and Ar’Uzkul to the Dwarfs.\\n\\nOn this night, sensible folk lock their doors and bar their windows, but for the followers of the Dark Gods this is a night of celebration. Morrslieb is accursed, a moon formed from material cast into the skies when Chaos first bunt upon the world.\\n\\nIts proximity strengthens the Winds of Magic, weakening the borders between reality and the Realm of Chaos. On Geheimnisnacht, small rifts become large and large rifts become immense, allowing thousands of Daemons to walk the mortal world for one night of mayhem and destruction.\\n\\nMorrslieb’s chaotic orbit means that Geheimnisnacht never falls upon the same day in subsequent years, but mortal folk take care never to be surprised by its onset. Defences are strengthened on this, the unholiest of nights, with special care given to those places riddled with folk rumour of dark powers abroad.\\n\\nIn the Drakwald and Mousillon, peasants abandon their hovels and take shelter in castles and fortified inns. In the Ogre Kingdoms, cauldron after cauldron of bloody meat are sacrificed to appease the Great Maw and secure its protection for the faithful.\\n\\nBeneath Zhufbar, ill-famed caverns are scaled tight by Runesmiths, their exits guarded by dour Ironbreakers and eager Slayers. Across Ulthuan and in the depths of Athel Loren, prayers are whispered to Isha and Asuryan in the light of the sacred phoenix flames. Rich and poor, young and old; all hope that the evils of Geheimnisnacht will pass over them; all hope that the night of evils will have them unmarked by its infinite malice.\\n\\nEventually darkness retreats from the sky. Morrslieb begins its slow wane and folk venture out into the new dawn. Some discover neighbouring villages razed to the ground, no trace of the inhabitants to be found save for blood on charred limbers.\\n\\nOthers take axes to trees that have twisted into unspeakable shapes, burn crops rotten through with pestilence, or empty barrels now choked thick with black and diseased blood. All give thanks to have survived another Geheimnisnacht and fearfully begin counting the days until it is upon them once again.\\n	false

gen_lore_chs_naming_of_daemons_description	A Daemon’s true name is commonly a rolling tide of guttural syllables beyond the wit of most to even read, let alone pronounce. Virtually all Daemons take care to keep their true names secret. Knowledge of a true name grants advantage, and Daemons do not surrender such power lightly. Only the most powerful Greater Daemons, who need not fear domination by any other creature, do not bother to hide their true names.\\n\\nAs a result of keeping their true names hidden. Daemons use a number of false names and titles. These can vary according to circumstance – such use-names are not important to a Daemon, as they give no real benefit to anyone who knows them.\\n\\nA Daemon always chooses a name to reflect its nature. G’rauhilatarak, a servant of Khorne, has variously held titles such as The High Handed Slayer of Innocence, Goreflench and Skullrend. Similarly, the Keeper of Secrets Lach’relarian’sithelme has rejoiced in use-names reflecting Slaanesh’s obsessions. such as Vilescream, Sindancer and The Lurking Despoiler.\\n\\nOn other occasions, a Daemon will be so pleased with an epithet applied by those it has fought that he adopts the mane for his own. H’guturhtuk Urg’pelagua favoured the title of Fluxrot until the Battle of Barren Hill.\\n\\nThose Empire militiamen fortunate enough not to drown in the Great Unclean One’s putrid vomit screamed the name Bileflood as they fled the tide of seething and maggoty goo. Most pleased with this panicked description, H’guturhtuk decreed that he would henceforth be addressed as Father Bileflood.\\n\\nOf all Daemons, it is the feathered Lords of Change who most often adopt fresh titles. As Daemons that constantly alter their colour, size and even form on a whimsical basis, the winged watchers see little value in restricting themselves to a single given form of address.\\n\\nSo it is that a Lord of Change may have a hundred or more different titles in use at any one time, some of which are shared between a dozen or more other Greater Daemons. These labyrinthine practices make the identification of any particular Lord of Change a most vexing and complicated process: but then, that is probably the point!	false

gen_lore_dae_daemonic_magic_description	Mortal wizards must be born with a talent for manipulating the chaotic energy of the Winds of Magic. Those who are not consumed by their birthright spend a lifetime refining their skill and broadening their understanding, learning greater control and ever more powerful expressions of their gift.\\n\\nBy contrast, Daemons are timeless and unchanging. A Daemon’s skills – indeed its entire being – are fixed at the moment of creation. They cannot grow and develop as mortals can. Those Daemons steeped in the mysteries of magic were created with that knowledge, and it rarely grows or diminishes. The only way for a Daemon’s mastery of magic to improve is through a gift from its God. As each Daemon is an expression of the Dark Gods’ own being, for one Daemon to be empowered, another is diminished.\\n\\nOf all Daemons, the most talented mystics are those loyal to Tzeentch, the Great Sorcerer. Tzeentch’s followers have the broadest knowledge of magic’s applications. The most favoured Lords of Change are said to know many of the thousands of spells in existence. Tzeentchian magic is wild and destructive, specialising in warping bursts of coloured Daemonfire, though it also has a subtler side, as befits the Great Schemer. Many Daemons of Tzeentch use their magical skills to glean additional power from the Winds of Magic or even manipulate the minds of enemy wizards.\\n\\nFew of Nurgle’s Daemons possess the same magical abilities as their Tzeentchian rivals, for the Plaguelord views magic as a means to an end, and not the end itself. Nonetheless, Nurgle has enthusiastically embraced sorcery as one of many carriers for his multitude of diseases. The spells used by Daemons of Nurgle afflict the foe with all manner of ghastly pestilences, or weaken the enemy and make them more vulnerable to disease. Nurglesque magic leaves nothing in its wake save liquefying corpses and the buzzing of thousands of thick black flies that grow fat on the putrefaction.\\n\\nSlaanesh is as intrigued by the art of magic as he is with any other route to power. Though he lacks Tzeentch’s innate ability to read and control the flow of energy, the Dark Prince is forever trying to better his mystical skills. Such pursuits are futile, for each of the Dark Gods is trapped in a predestined role just as their Daemons are, but the same obsessive nature from which Slaanesh draws his power also drives him onwards. The only defence against Slaaneshi magic is a strong will, for it plays upon senses, tempting mind and body with deceptive and damning pleasures or bestowing experiences so extreme that they kill.\\n\\nKhorne does not employ sorcery. The Lord of Skulls abhors the practice of spellcrafting, deeming it to be the tool of weaklings and cowards. Some heretical scholars have postulated that Khorne’s detestation of the mysteries rises from immense pride: the Blood God does not suffer himself to be anything other than the supreme power in any field of endeavour.\\n\\nThis is not to say that Khorne shuns magic entirely; just its connections to those who would in victory through the manipulation of energies rather than through the righteous pounding of blade upon flesh. Khorne is master of binding runes of destruction and pain into swords, axes, shields and armour. To Khorne, this is magic’s sole honourable function: to make his champions ever stronger, and to spill ever more blood in His name.\\n	false

Most of their claims are contradictory. However, many mention the legend of the Great Game – a mythical contest of war and wits fought between the four Ruinous Powers.\\n\\nThe Dark Gods ally with one another only when it suits them, and often fight against each other for the most spurious reasons. Tzeentch, Slaanesh, Nurgle, and Khorne constantly compete to become the most powerful of the Chaos gods. They are united only in their determination to destroy the civilised world.\\n\\nThe Great Game is played out in three arenas. Within the Realm of Chaos, the four gods send armies of daemons and the most powerful of their mortal champions to assault each other’s domains. However, the defences surrounding their infernal kingdoms are almost impossible to breach.\\n\\nThe second theatre is the Chaos Wastes of the mortal world, where warrior-wizards lead barbarian tribes and warbands against the mortal armies of the rival Chaos gods. The slaughter takes place on battlegrounds that constantly warp and change as a tempest of Dark Magic rages overhead. Battles are won and battles are lost, and no single deity ever dominates.\\n\\nThese battles are testing grounds for their champions, where the weak fall and the strong are prepared for the main arena of the Great Game: the civilised realms of the Old World.

gen_lore_kho_sacred_number_eight_description	There is no mortal record of why the number eight is sacred to Khorne, for this number has been bound to him and he to it since even before time began. Some say that eight is his number because eight mighty gods were slain by Khorne in the moment of his birth, and their skulls are the foundation for his skull throne.\\n\\nOthers have postulated that eight great ages of war and slaughter will pass before Khorne’s bloodthirst is finally slaked. Whatever the reason, the figure and its multiples are strongly reflected in the organisation of Khorne’s daemon armies, from the number of Bloodthirster ranks to the number of cohorts in a full strength legion, and in the largest of wars prosecuted by Khorne’s minions, it is the eighth assault wave that is the most powerful of all.\\n\\nIt is a number that also appears throughout the Blood God’s domain: there are eight main gates to access the Brass Citadel, and eight towers guard its outermost wall; a slain daemon must survive eight battles within the flames of Helbrass before Khorne will once again give them physical shape.\\n\\nIt is not only Khorne’s daemonic armies that make use of the sacred number eight, for the hordes of his mortal followers also revere it as the blessed value of the Blood God, and the number is central to many of their blood-soaked tribal rituals.\\n\\nFor instance, on the banks of the Blood Marshes, idolaters of Khorne sacrifice eight noble warriors in the crafting of each of their brass-graven statues, casting their hearts within the molten metal and burnishing the facets with their blood.\\n\\nAt the Altar of the Crimson harvest, aspirant tribespeople are initiated into the ranks of the Flesh Carvers only after they have sawn off two of their own fingers and two of their own toes to display the sacred number eight proudly on their body.\\n	false

Their life is one ceaseless campaign of war, cutting swathes through all they find until they themselves are slain or they are recalled by Khorne for some more pressing duty.\\n\\nDuring the course of these constant campaigns, should cohorts of the Blood Legions be reduced in number, they will simply fight on at reduced strength. If losses are severe, the remaining daemons will seek to join other formations, and if none are available, they will simply continue their killing spree as best they can.\\n\\nThroughout history there are tales of travellers encountering small bands of Khornate daemons, roaming the lands in search of blood.

But none ever entreat Khorne for gifts of sorcery, as it is known that such requests will never be answered – save perhaps for a visitation by the Blood God’s hounds.\\n\\nKhorne despises magic, for it is the antithesis of the physical exertion he favours. Strength, skill and face-to-face slaughter are the sole tenets of worship that he demands. Those who use magic spend their lives studying ancient tomes and learning obsequious litanies rather than tearing free the skulls of their enemies and offering them to Khorne in tribute.\\n\\nThey either eschew close combat or use their powers to aid them – a revolting deceit no better than those who attempt to triumph through trickery and artifice rather than pure brawn, martial skill, and sheer bloody-minded physical determination.\\n	false

Such prized gifts are forged from the heat of Khorne’s rage at the very foot of the Blood God’s throne, and they contain a portion of his indomitable will.\\n\\nSome say that the collars’ power comes from infusions of the blood of powerful wizards slain by Khorne’s followers, while others claim that the devices exude a fraction of the Blood God’s eternal loathing for any form of witchcraft. All that is known for sure is that the collars repel magic, making their wearers the bane of sorcerers.\\n\\nEven the most powerful of mages finds spells directed at a target wearing a Collar of Khorne fizzling out ineffectively or disappearing harmlessly into the air. As their incantations falter, some casters have even heard harsh, barking laughter – like the rumble of distant thunder – as their eldritch efforts come to naught.\\n\\nBecause of their anti-magic aura, the Flesh Hounds of Khorne are highly feared by wizards. Sorcerers of all races tell warning tales and horror stories of those in their craft who heard the hellish baying and could not escape. No enchantment or conjured illusion can throw the Flesh Hounds off the scent of their quarry, and they will not cease chasing down their prey until their dagger-like teeth have rent apart the object of their hunt.\\n\\nMost Collars of Khorne are made up of simple brass, although while in the act of cancelling out magic, runes and sigils of Khorne can often be seen blazing to life along these unadorned bands. The collars are sometimes studded or spiked, and those bearing iron spikes often have them on both the outside and inside of the ring.\\n\\nThe eternal heat of the Collar of Khorne’s forging binds it to its recipient, shrinking to a tight fit so that not even a claw can come between the device and its wearer’s skin. Once so clasped, nothing short of decapitation can remove the thick band of metal from around its owner’s neck.\\n	false

Others, such as those of the Jagged Tide, are a much deeper hue, like that of muscle tissue or thickly caked gore.\\n\\nCertain daemons bear the same colouring across their entire form, whereas others, like the Severers Cohort, display discolouration on parts of their bodies. These distinctions have led to many different cohorts being identified by mortals; their infamous acts of savagery are remembered in horror, and whispered of in hushed tones.\\n\\nCohorts tend to all bear similar blades and armour.

His legions attack with brutish might, and none can equal their lust for violence. Khorne’s offspring are blessed with unholy strength so that each of their blows carves through armour and cleaves bone. Their preternatural gifts of speed and precision allow their jagged blades to thrust through parries and rend the flesh of their enemies.\\n\\nThose most favoured leaders – the dreaded Bloodthirsters and Heralds – are also endowed with a portion of the Blood God’s infinite military understanding. With but a fraction of his battle acumen, Khorne’s generals are able to carve through armies and topple cities, ordering their savage forces to shred massed infantry and leave the enemy champions to be engaged in glorious single combat.\\n\\nA Khornate legion charging its enemy has the appearance of a tumultuous stampede of rage-blind beasts. This apparent tempest is actually a regimented military body, however, sharpened like an executioner’s axe for the sole purpose of waging war.\\n\\nAs a daemon forge’s hellfires are stoked to infernal perfection for the crafting of blades, so too is the full fury of Khorne’s daemons ignited moments before they cleave into an opposing army. The order and direction of their assaults – no matter how savage – are as considered and well chosen as any orchestrated by the most tactically brilliant commanders in the Mortal Realms.\\n	false

gen_lore_kho_blades_of_blood_description	To those Bloodletters who prove themselves with extreme acts of violence Khorne grants further opportunities to earn his favour. In the brutish trials and forced combats that follow, the victor not only leeches the energies of those that they vanquish, but they are also gifted an extra sliver of the Blood God’s boundless rage.\\n\\nThis fell energy empowers and transforms the daemon’s hellblade, which still drips with the blood of those it had slain. Henceforth known as a blade of blood, these profane artefacts slaver for the taste of viscera, and guide their wielder’s swings unerringly towards vulnerable spots in their opponent’s defence. Each strike not only penetrates armour and flesh, but also the target’s immortal soul.\\n\\nAlthough their wielders have a fondness for decapitating blows, blades of blood need only to deliver a mere scratch to draw out a foe’s soul. Those few who survive wounds from such weapons are forever scarred both physically and mentally.\\n	false

gen_lore_kho_axes_of_khorne_description	The axe is Khorne’s favoured weapon. Heavy, brutal, and ideal for lopping heads, the axe suits the Blood God’s warriors perfectly. It is unsurprising, then, that when Khorne gifts one of his followers with a weapon of power, it will nearly always be an axe of Khorne.\\n\\nThe precise nature of these fell weapons varies, dependent upon the whims of the Blood God and of the daemonic smiths who forge them. One axe might be a black-spiked creation of living brass that screams as it devours the souls of its prey, while the next may be a bone-fanged horror that rips holes in reality, or a twisted blade that flickers with daemonfire and sets its victims alight at the slightest touch.\\n\\nOthers still cause living wounds that rapidly grow so that the slightest cut will tear a warrior in half. Whatever its form, an axe of Khorne always bears the Blood God’s rune, and contains the bound essence of a raging daemon. Such a blade must be fought and mastered at all times, for it will take the life of an unworthy wielder as easily as those of his foes.\\n	false

The Blood Warrior used his weapon to hook aside a Tomb Guard’s shield, his return swing scything through the gold-armoured warrior’s neck. The decapitated skeleton collapsed into a pile of inanimate bones, and Arbhax felt Khorne’s eyes upon him.\\n\\nAt his side Vorghos, his last surviving comrade, was fighting with equal fury. As Arbhax watched through a red haze, Vorghos shrugged off a scything blow to his chest and planted his boot into the skull of the last remaining Tomb Guard.\\n\\nIt died in a flash of fell light, and Arbhax turned, gaze roving the corpse-strewn battlefield for fresh foes. He never saw the blow coming, sudden agony exploding between his shoulder blades as he was thrown face-first into the sand.\\n\\nSnarling, Arbhax managed to roll himself over, only for Vorghos to plant one brass-shod boot on his chest. As the other Blood Warrior raised his axe for the killing blow, Arbhax spat hate-filled curses at him, yet it was only right. The strongest prevailed. Blood for the Blood God. With that last thought, Vorghos’ axe came down and Arbhax met his end.\\n	false

Rushing to meet them, Khorne’s warriors howled challenges of their own, beating their weapons together until the air rang with the deafening clangour of Khorne’s own forge.\\n\\nThe two armies crashed together with earth-shaking violence, the clash of weapons and the screams of the dying creating a hellish cacophony. Khornate Wrathmongers ploughed through the Beastmen’s ragged ranks with their wrath-flails spinning.\\n\\nBlood splattered in all directions as the chained hammers smashed skulls and shattered limbs.

The centre of the Beastmen’s line of battle buckled inward under the furious onslaught, hundreds of hacked and mangled corpses falling to be trampled underfoot.\\n\\nUndaunted by the ferocity of the slaughter, the Beastmen fought back. Fresh waves of warriors loped from the shimmering jade forest. Bray-shamans hurled bolts of dark magic that blasted Bloodletters to ash, while a wedge of Bestigors hacked their way into the Blood Warriors’ lines.\\n\\nMore warriors charged into the spreading melee, any pretence of order or discipline evaporating as combatants from both sides chopped, battered, clawed and bit.

Despite himself, the Slaughterpriest was impressed with the strength and resilience of Golch’s followers. Even if their glottal chortling was irksome in the extreme...\\n\\nPushing his fingers through the ribcage of a fallen shaman, Grakhas tore out the creature’s heart. The hulking Slaughterpriest raised the organ above his face and squeezed, gulping down thick, semi-congealed gore.\\n\\nAs he did so, Brassfang felt his blood simmer and churn in response, visions of glorious murder dancing behind his eyes. As the trance passed, the Slaughterpriest found himself on his knees, his and Golch’s warriors gathered expectantly around him. Slowly, Grakhas rose. He hefted his axe and grinned savagely around at his warband.\\n\\n“Well?” bubbled Golch through rotten lips. `What sayst thy goresome god, Bloodspeaker?’\\n\\nIn response, Brassfang swung his axe, all of his monstrous strength behind a blow that sent Golch’s surprised-looking head bouncing down the slope.\\n\\n“He says you die, Rotbringer!

Beneath him, his Juggernaut ploughed towards the Bonechewers, steam howling and pistons thumping in time to its thudding hoofbeats. Kharvax rode the savage motion of his steed’s charge with practised ease, wind whipping past him as he charged.\\n\\nA volley of flint-tipped arrows rose from the Greenskin’s lines, directed towards Kharvax and the Mighty Skullcrushers that thundered at his heels. The arrows seemed to mass like a dark cloud, then suddenly they were slashing down like storm-rain, striking sparks from Kharvax’s armour and the brass hide of his steed.\\n\\nThe Mighty Skullcrusher barked a savage laugh as the arrows pierced Lakhorg’s armour, sending the knight tumbling from his saddle in a tangle of limbs. Another skull for Khorne, thought Kharvax, before dismissing Lakhorg from his thoughts. He was seconds from the enemy lines now, close enough to see the Greenskins’ eyes widen in alarm at the impetus of the Khornate charge.\\n\\nGripping his Juggernaut’s collar with one gauntlet, Kharvax leant low over its thick neck and swept his axe high in the other fist. A split-second later, the Mighty Skullcrushers struck the Bonechewer lines with a ferocious crash. Kharvax roared furious oaths as he swung his weapon in a killing arc. Blood flew as they slammed through the Greenskins like boulders hurled by an angry god.\\n\\nGreen-skinned warriors were smashed to pulp by the impact, flint spears and axes clattering against brass armour. Kharvax’s blade cleaved through thick green necks, gore spattering his helm as the stumps jetted streams of blood. Raising his head, the Skullcrusher roared, his steed joining its bellows to his own.

The Ogre swung his club in a wild arc, but in his panic he aimed wide. Gouge’s horn punched through Skargut’s ribs even as Baudrax’s axe sent the Ogre’s head tumbling from his thick neck.\\n\\nBaudrax threw his own head back and roared his triumph to the bloody skies.

gen_lore_sla_vaults_of_winter_description	The Wood Elves of Athel Loren have many tales concerning the Daemons of Chaos. The most important stories are recounted by the Wardancers – warrior bards who shape stories into dances of life and death. For them the tale with the most power concerns one of their own, a young Wardancer whose pride wrought great ruin on her kin.\\n\\nCirienvel, for this was the Wardancer’s name, was blessed with a skill of the dance that few could match, yet this was not enough to sate her ambitions. She prayed to Loec, patron of the Wardancers, pleading for help to surpass her peers, and to become the greatest storyteller and dancer of all.\\n\\nFor weeks Cirienvel pleaded in her prayers. Finally, a charismatic presence, whom Cirienvel believed to be Loec himself, entered the Wardancer’s dreams. Calling Cirienvel by name, the handsome being bade her enter the Vaults of Winter and seek the Casket of Dreams.\\n\\nUpon waking, Cirienvel sought the advice of Naieth the Prophetess, wisest of the Wood Elf seers. Troubled by Cirienvel’s words, Naieth forbade the young Wardancer to enter the Vaults. The caverns were thick with evils that only the watchfulness of Dryad guardians could contain, and the seer did not believe that anything benevolent could be found within those chill depths.\\n\\nYet the seer’s words found no purchase on Cirienvel, for the promise of the vision had sheathed her heart against good counsel. Taking her leave of the prophetess, Cirienvel journeyed to the Vaults of Winter. Taking care to remain unseen by the Dryads who guarded the entrance, Cirienvel slipped inside.\\n\\nTime seemed to stand still as Cirienvel journeyed through the icy caverns. The guardians of the Vaults were many and foul, with the stink of evil magics about them. Some lurked in the shadows and sang alluring songs of bitter promise that misted in the chill air, Cirienvel closed her ears to them and travelled on. Others fell upon her with claws, blades and snapping teeth, yet Cirienvel was the swifter, and she dodged the attacks of the cavern’s denizens and cut them down with blades of her own.\\n\\nThrough temptation and torment Cirienvel passed unhindered until, in the deepest cavern of the vaults, she found the golden Casket of Dreams beneath a blanket of frost. Unheeding of her surroundings and the danger that lurked close by, Cirienvel lifted the Casket from its icy cradle.\\n\\nWithout hesitation, Cirienvel freed the hasps, threw back the lid and gasped as the power of the Casket flooded into her. In an instant she gazed upon the dreams of thousands, of untold stories and the dances that could tell those tales. As Cirienvel revelled in her prize, sardonic laughter echoed around the cavern. Awakening from her reverie with a jolt, Cirienvel sensed a foe approached that she could not best. Clutching her prize tightly, Cirienvel fled the Vaults of Winter.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_the_dance_of_dreams_description	That night, infused with the power of the casket, Cirienvel danced in the King’s Glade for the Council of Kindreds and an audience of thousands. Watching from the second circle of the glade, Naieth knew something to be wrong as soon as the dance began.\\n\\nSo swift did Cirienvel move that blurred images remained in her wake, each impossible pose captured in sparkling light. Yet as the Wardancer moved faster and faster, the silent figures that made up the tableau sprang to life. As they did so, their true nature was betrayed – they were echoes of Cirienvel no more, but Daemonettes of Slaanesh unleashed by the magic of the dance and drawn to the scent of Cirienvel’s foolish pride.\\n\\nThe Daemonettes fell upon the gathered Elves without mercy, claws slashing and voices keening in time to Cirienvel’s dance. As the Wood Elves fought for their lives, the trees of the glade writhed as if roused to agony by the Daemons in their midst. Still the tempo of the dance increased.\\n\\nPink Horrors burst from the writhing tree-flesh, the light from their wild spells casting impossible shadows. The ground was slick with blood as the Daemonettes darted and struck. Bloodletters emerged where the slaughter was greatest, hauling themselves out of the blood-soaked earth.\\n\\nThrough it all, Cirienvel danced on, as unable to stop her motion as she was to undo the harm it had wrought. A massive creature began to take shape within the centre of the glade, translucent almost to invisibility, but becoming more solid with each movement of the dance.\\n\\nBowstrings sang out across the glade as the Elves fought back. Some arrows shattered against Daemonic skin, but others bit deep. Kinband chieftains shouted orders. Glaive opposed Hellblade and sword parried claws. Hundreds fell on each side, but the Daemons cared not for the loss.\\n\\nFor their part, the Wood Elves could not yield lest the minions of Chaos run rampant through the sacred land of Athel Loren. Gnarled and ancient Treemen joined the fray, their craggy forms casting evil shadows in the light of the fires. Dryads burst from the treeline to claw and impale Daemonettes with their talons. Yet even these interventions could not reverse the plight of the Elves.\\n\\nThrough it all, Cirienvel danced ever faster. The more swiftly she danced, the more swiftly did the Daemons appear. The Wardancer was a blur, moving far faster than any mortal. The horned figure at the dance’s heart threw back his head and peals of dark laughter swept across the glade.\\n\\nIt was then that Naieth glimpsed salvation – she saw the Casket of Dreams, curiously untouched by the maelstrom of battle. The Prophetess reached out to the wild magic billowing through the glade. Taming a portion of energy to her will, Naieth lashed out thrice at the Casket of Dreams with tendrils of sorcerous fire.\\n\\nOn the third strike, the chest burst asunder. Filigreed fragments hurtled across the glade. Cirienvel collapsed – a puppet whose strings had been severed. The horned figure vanished. The air crackled and warped where the casket had sat, and the Daemons were cast into the screaming rift, buffeted by unseen winds that found no purchase on the Elves. Within seconds, it was over.\\n\\nThough Naieth’s actions had saved Athel Loren, Cirienvel would bear the mark of her folly for the rest of her life. Though she had survived, a terrible numbness had settled into her limbs. Ever after, Cirienvel’s movement was pain-wracked and clumsy.\\n\\nThe skill of the dance had gone from her, sacrificed to the creator of the Casket of Dreams. For the rest of her life, Cirienvel was haunted by the memories of what she had once been, and of the horned beast who waited to claim her soul.\\n	false

gen_lore_kho_sack_braquiron_description	On Winter’s Eve, almost 500 years after the reign of Gilles le Breton, hell came to the Bretonnian town of Braquiron in the dukedom of Quenelles. As dusk fell, spouts of flame sprang up on the borders of the domain, cutting Braquiron and much of the surrounding valley off from the rest of Bretonnia.\\n\\nSensing something terrible was soon to occur, Baron Callard mustered his knights and yeomen. All too soon, a stream of bloodied and terrified peasant refugees confirmed the Baron’s fears. Two great hosts of Daemons, each led by a single Bloodthirster, were converging on Braquiron from north and south, slaying all in their path. Callard beseeched the townspeople to flee into the hills or take shelter in his keep and led his followers south, hoping to defeat each horde individually before they could combine.\\n\\nThe Baron’s army confronted the Daemon host two leagues south of the city. Pennants fluttered in the wind as the Bretonnian knights charged into the midst of the foe. At first, the battle seemed to favour the sons of Bretonnia, as the knights drove deep into enemy lines, lances and swords piercing scaled hides and severing foul limbs.\\n\\nAs the tang of blood filled the air, a terrible fury awakened in the Daemons. They struck back against the knights with hellspawned rage. Flesh Hounds tore out the throats of horses, pitching the knights to the ground for Bloodletters to disembowel.\\n\\nEach stroke of the Bloodthirster’s axe slew a dozen men. Within moments, the Bretonnian charge was in disarray, and eight-score knights doomed to a terrible death. Callard himself was only saved through the cowardice of his steed. As the Baron led the charge, his horse was consumed with terror and bore him away at great speed.\\n\\nBy the time Callard had calmed his horse the battle was over. The Baron’s proud army was now a grisly collection of skull trophies and steaming horseflesh. Stung by the shame of defeat, Callard reluctantly set spurs to his horse and returned to his castle and the siege he now thought inevitable.\\n	false

From the ramparts of his keep, the Baron watched as the two hosts spat curses at each other across the town square. Few of the keep’s defenders slept that night. Those that did suffered from dreams haunted by the howls of Flesh Hounds and chanting of Bloodletters as the two hosts performed pre-battle rituals.\\n\\nThen, as dawn broke, the Daemon hordes ceased their cacophony. The Bloodthirsters hefted their axes in salute, and the carnage began. Within moments, the town was embroiled in the most savage battle Callard had ever witnessed.\\n\\nThe valley trembled as the two Bloodthirsters hacked and cut at one another, bellowing insults and challenges. The other Daemons fought for their overlords. Legions of Bloodletters hacked and clawed, chanting the Blood God’s praises as hellblades rose and fell. Flesh Hounds clawed at one another with single-minded ferocity.\\n\\nSo it went on for a dozen days and nights. Though the battle raged back and forth across the increasingly ruined town, neither Daemonic host could prevail. As the town below drowned in a sea of blood-gorged madness, Baron Callard watched from the ramparts of his castle, helpless to prevent the destruction.\\n\\nBuildings collapsed under the weight of battling Daemons, or were demolished by the sweep of a Bloodthirster’s axe gone astray. Temples were tainted by spilt Daemon blood. Fallen pillars and roof beams were wielded as weapons, while the Bloodthirsters seized huge chunks of rubble and hurled them as missiles into the ranks of Bloodletters. With every hour that passed the two armies dwindled, worn down by mutual bloodlust and ferocity.\\n\\nOn the morning of the thirteenth day, only the two Bloodthirsters remained standing. Their titanic battle had brought them to a vine-strewn Grail Chapel, sanctuary of the fabled Sword Perilous. This desecration finally spurred Callard into action.\\n\\nBad enough that he had been forced to watch as his land and his knights were ravaged, but Callard could not allow the raging Daemons to despoil the Grail Chapel. Callard did not credit his chances against the two behemoths that remained, but the shame of flight from battle – unwilling though it was – urged the Baron to try.\\n	false

gen_lore_kho_callard_rides_out_description	Ordering the gate unbarred, Callard mounted his destrier and rode down into the valley. Everywhere tokens of profitless slaughter stood in testament to the battle that had raged. As the knight spurred onwards through the smouldering rubble that had once been Braquiron, wounded Flesh Hounds ceased gnawing at their own entrails to snap at his horse’s legs.\\n\\nCountless scrawl-covered banners lay trampled into the mud, their bearers hacked and torn apart. Piles of oddly-shaped Daemon skulls were stacked amongst the rubble, leering dark promises of death at Callard as he passed.\\n\\nAhead, in the ruins of the chapel, the gore encrusted behemoths fought on. Already their battle had tumbled the outer walls, laying the shrine’s altar bare. The hillside shuddered with each blow, yet still neither Daemon could best the other. With one final prayer to the Lady, Callard mustered his courage and set his lance. The knight screamed a challenge as his horse sprang forward, yet the Daemons heeded him not until he was within striking distance.\\n\\nGuided by the Lady, the lance struck the closest Daemon, the knight’s momentum driving the iron tip through the brazen armour. Rage and pain mingled in the bat-winged behemoth’s roar. It swung around to face the knight, dealing Callard a savage blow that sent him tumbling from the saddle onto the altar of the shattered grail chapel.\\n\\nYet, in so doing, the Bloodthirster had turned his back upon his brother Daemon, which now smote him a mighty blow that snapped his spine and cast him to the ruined ground. The axe rose and fell again and again before the wounded creature could recover, each swing marking the walls and weed-strewn flagstones with trails of blood. Eight times the axe rose and fell, and on the eighth stroke the victorious Bloodthirster severed the head of his fallen opponent.\\n	false

As the Bloodthirster threw back its head and bellowed a cry of victory, Callard remembered the slaughtered knights in the valley below, the ruin that had been wrought on Braquiron. Rage flowed into the Baron and with it came fresh courage and strength. The knight hauled himself to his feet and drew the Sword Perilous from its sheath upon the altar.\\n\\nThe anger rose within Callard once again, and the knight embraced it. Lessons in swordplay and fencing fell away like wilted leaves. Canard struck at the monster again and again, with no thought of tactic or finesse, senselessly battering the creature with all the strength he could muster. Impossibly, the injured knight began to prevail, his rage overwhelming his foe’s defences. Callard’s third strike shattered the beast’s left hand, and its barbed lash fell to the ground. His fifth broke the Daemon’s thigh and his seventh near severed a wing.\\n\\nIn desperation the Daemon cast aside its axe. Closing its undamaged taloned hand around the knight’s neck, the Bloodthirster began to throttle its foe. As the creature’s grip tightened, Callard’s vision grew dimmer. He could feel his bones grating under the Daemon’s fearsome grasp and realised he had but seconds to live. With his final breath, Callard thrust the Sword Perilous forward one last time. The gleaming blade penetrated the Bloodthirster’s armour and pierced the creature’s black heart.

Of the Daemons no trace remained, save for the rank ichor that stained every inch of the town’s ruins.\\n\\nThe Sword Perilous was discovered amid the ruins of the Grail Chapel, its golden finials melted and blackened. Of Sir Callard, there was no sign. None could be sure of what had occurred in that final battle, but Callard would be remembered as a hero, a knight pure enough of heart to vanquish the greatest of Daemons.\\n\\nDarker tales abound, however.

gen_lore_wef_vaults_of_winter_description	The Wood Elves of Athel Loren have many tales concerning the Daemons of Chaos. The most important stories are recounted by the Wardancers – warrior bards who shape stories into dances of life and death. For them the tale with the most power concerns one of their own, a young Wardancer whose pride wrought great ruin on her kin.\\n\\nCirienvel, for this was the Wardancer’s name, was blessed with a skill of the dance that few could match, yet this was not enough to sate her ambitions. She prayed to Loec, patron of the Wardancers, pleading for help to surpass her peers, and to become the greatest storyteller and dancer of all.\\n\\nFor weeks Cirienvel pleaded in her prayers. Finally, a charismatic presence, whom Cirienvel believed to be Loec himself, entered the Wardancer’s dreams. Calling Cirienvel by name, the handsome being bade her enter the Vaults of Winter and seek the Casket of Dreams.\\n\\nUpon waking, Cirienvel sought the advice of Naieth the Prophetess, wisest of the Wood Elf seers. Troubled by Cirienvel’s words, Naieth forbade the young Wardancer to enter the Vaults. The caverns were thick with evils that only the watchfulness of Dryad guardians could contain, and the seer did not believe that anything benevolent could be found within those chill depths.\\n\\nYet the seer’s words found no purchase on Cirienvel, for the promise of the vision had sheathed her heart against good counsel. Taking her leave of the prophetess, Cirienvel journeyed to the Vaults of Winter. Taking care to remain unseen by the Dryads who guarded the entrance, Cirienvel slipped inside.\\n\\nTime seemed to stand still as Cirienvel journeyed through the icy caverns. The guardians of the Vaults were many and foul, with the stink of evil magics about them. Some lurked in the shadows and sang alluring songs of bitter promise that misted in the chill air, Cirienvel closed her ears to them and travelled on. Others fell upon her with claws, blades and snapping teeth, yet Cirienvel was the swifter, and she dodged the attacks of the cavern’s denizens and cut them down with blades of her own.\\n\\nThrough temptation and torment Cirienvel passed unhindered until, in the deepest cavern of the vaults, she found the golden Casket of Dreams beneath a blanket of frost. Unheeding of her surroundings and the danger that lurked close by, Cirienvel lifted the Casket from its icy cradle.\\n\\nWithout hesitation, Cirienvel freed the hasps, threw back the lid and gasped as the power of the Casket flooded into her. In an instant she gazed upon the dreams of thousands, of untold stories and the dances that could tell those tales. As Cirienvel revelled in her prize, sardonic laughter echoed around the cavern. Awakening from her reverie with a jolt, Cirienvel sensed a foe approached that she could not best. Clutching her prize tightly, Cirienvel fled the Vaults of Winter.\\n	false

gen_lore_wef_the_dance_of_dreams_description	That night, infused with the power of the casket, Cirienvel danced in the King’s Glade for the Council of Kindreds and an audience of thousands. Watching from the second circle of the glade, Naieth knew something to be wrong as soon as the dance began.\\n\\nSo swift did Cirienvel move that blurred images remained in her wake, each impossible pose captured in sparkling light. Yet as the Wardancer moved faster and faster, the silent figures that made up the tableau sprang to life. As they did so, their true nature was betrayed – they were echoes of Cirienvel no more, but Daemonettes of Slaanesh unleashed by the magic of the dance and drawn to the scent of Cirienvel’s foolish pride.\\n\\nThe Daemonettes fell upon the gathered Elves without mercy, claws slashing and voices keening in time to Cirienvel’s dance. As the Wood Elves fought for their lives, the trees of the glade writhed as if roused to agony by the Daemons in their midst. Still the tempo of the dance increased.\\n\\nPink Horrors burst from the writhing tree-flesh, the light from their wild spells casting impossible shadows. The ground was slick with blood as the Daemonettes darted and struck. Bloodletters emerged where the slaughter was greatest, hauling themselves out of the blood-soaked earth.\\n\\nThrough it all, Cirienvel danced on, as unable to stop her motion as she was to undo the harm it had wrought. A massive creature began to take shape within the centre of the glade, translucent almost to invisibility, but becoming more solid with each movement of the dance.\\n\\nBowstrings sang out across the glade as the Elves fought back. Some arrows shattered against Daemonic skin, but others bit deep. Kinband chieftains shouted orders. Glaive opposed Hellblade and sword parried claws. Hundreds fell on each side, but the Daemons cared not for the loss.\\n\\nFor their part, the Wood Elves could not yield lest the minions of Chaos run rampant through the sacred land of Athel Loren. Gnarled and ancient Treemen joined the fray, their craggy forms casting evil shadows in the light of the fires. Dryads burst from the treeline to claw and impale Daemonettes with their talons. Yet even these interventions could not reverse the plight of the Elves.\\n\\nThrough it all, Cirienvel danced ever faster. The more swiftly she danced, the more swiftly did the Daemons appear. The Wardancer was a blur, moving far faster than any mortal. The horned figure at the dance’s heart threw back his head and peals of dark laughter swept across the glade.\\n\\nIt was then that Naieth glimpsed salvation – she saw the Casket of Dreams, curiously untouched by the maelstrom of battle. The Prophetess reached out to the wild magic billowing through the glade. Taming a portion of energy to her will, Naieth lashed out thrice at the Casket of Dreams with tendrils of sorcerous fire.\\n\\nOn the third strike, the chest burst asunder. Filigreed fragments hurtled across the glade. Cirienvel collapsed – a puppet whose strings had been severed. The horned figure vanished. The air crackled and warped where the casket had sat, and the Daemons were cast into the screaming rift, buffeted by unseen winds that found no purchase on the Elves. Within seconds, it was over.\\n\\nThough Naieth’s actions had saved Athel Loren, Cirienvel would bear the mark of her folly for the rest of her life. Though she had survived, a terrible numbness had settled into her limbs. Ever after, Cirienvel’s movement was pain-wracked and clumsy.\\n\\nThe skill of the dance had gone from her, sacrificed to the creator of the Casket of Dreams. For the rest of her life, Cirienvel was haunted by the memories of what she had once been, and of the horned beast who waited to claim her soul.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_sack_braquiron_description	On Winter’s Eve, almost 500 years after the reign of Gilles le Breton, hell came to the Bretonnian town of Braquiron in the dukedom of Quenelles. As dusk fell, spouts of flame sprang up on the borders of the domain, cutting Braquiron and much of the surrounding valley off from the rest of Bretonnia.\\n\\nSensing something terrible was soon to occur, Baron Callard mustered his knights and yeomen. All too soon, a stream of bloodied and terrified peasant refugees confirmed the Baron’s fears. Two great hosts of Daemons, each led by a single Bloodthirster, were converging on Braquiron from north and south, slaying all in their path. Callard beseeched the townspeople to flee into the hills or take shelter in his keep and led his followers south, hoping to defeat each horde individually before they could combine.\\n\\nThe Baron’s army confronted the Daemon host two leagues south of the city. Pennants fluttered in the wind as the Bretonnian knights charged into the midst of the foe. At first, the battle seemed to favour the sons of Bretonnia, as the knights drove deep into enemy lines, lances and swords piercing scaled hides and severing foul limbs.\\n\\nAs the tang of blood filled the air, a terrible fury awakened in the Daemons. They struck back against the knights with hellspawned rage. Flesh Hounds tore out the throats of horses, pitching the knights to the ground for Bloodletters to disembowel.\\n\\nEach stroke of the Bloodthirster’s axe slew a dozen men. Within moments, the Bretonnian charge was in disarray, and eight-score knights doomed to a terrible death. Callard himself was only saved through the cowardice of his steed. As the Baron led the charge, his horse was consumed with terror and bore him away at great speed.\\n\\nBy the time Callard had calmed his horse the battle was over. The Baron’s proud army was now a grisly collection of skull trophies and steaming horseflesh. Stung by the shame of defeat, Callard reluctantly set spurs to his horse and returned to his castle and the siege he now thought inevitable.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_daemonic_duel_description	In the wake of the slaughter, the Daemons resumed their march upon Braquiron, utterly ignoring Castle Callard and its feeble garrison. From the ramparts of his keep, the Baron watched as the two hosts spat curses at each other across the town square. Few of the keep’s defenders slept that night. Those that did suffered from dreams haunted by the howls of Flesh Hounds and chanting of Bloodletters as the two hosts performed pre-battle rituals.\\n\\nThen, as dawn broke, the Daemon hordes ceased their cacophony. The Bloodthirsters hefted their axes in salute, and the carnage began. Within moments, the town was embroiled in the most savage battle Callard had ever witnessed.\\n\\nThe valley trembled as the two Bloodthirsters hacked and cut at one another, bellowing insults and challenges. The other Daemons fought for their overlords. Legions of Bloodletters hacked and clawed, chanting the Blood God’s praises as hellblades rose and fell. Flesh Hounds clawed at one another with single-minded ferocity.\\n\\nSo it went on for a dozen days and nights. Though the battle raged back and forth across the increasingly ruined town, neither Daemonic host could prevail. As the town below drowned in a sea of blood-gorged madness, Baron Callard watched from the ramparts of his castle, helpless to prevent the destruction.\\n\\nBuildings collapsed under the weight of battling Daemons, or were demolished by the sweep of a Bloodthirster’s axe gone astray. Temples were tainted by spilt Daemon blood. Fallen pillars and roof beams were wielded as weapons, while the Bloodthirsters seized huge chunks of rubble and hurled them as missiles into the ranks of Bloodletters. With every hour that passed the two armies dwindled, worn down by mutual bloodlust and ferocity.\\n\\nOn the morning of the thirteenth day, only the two Bloodthirsters remained standing. Their titanic battle had brought them to a vine-strewn Grail Chapel, sanctuary of the fabled Sword Perilous. This desecration finally spurred Callard into action.\\n\\nBad enough that he had been forced to watch as his land and his knights were ravaged, but Callard could not allow the raging Daemons to despoil the Grail Chapel. Callard did not credit his chances against the two behemoths that remained, but the shame of flight from battle – unwilling though it was – urged the Baron to try.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_callard_rides_out_description	Ordering the gate unbarred, Callard mounted his destrier and rode down into the valley. Everywhere tokens of profitless slaughter stood in testament to the battle that had raged. As the knight spurred onwards through the smouldering rubble that had once been Braquiron, wounded Flesh Hounds ceased gnawing at their own entrails to snap at his horse’s legs.\\n\\nCountless scrawl-covered banners lay trampled into the mud, their bearers hacked and torn apart. Piles of oddly-shaped Daemon skulls were stacked amongst the rubble, leering dark promises of death at Callard as he passed.\\n\\nAhead, in the ruins of the chapel, the gore encrusted behemoths fought on. Already their battle had tumbled the outer walls, laying the shrine’s altar bare. The hillside shuddered with each blow, yet still neither Daemon could best the other. With one final prayer to the Lady, Callard mustered his courage and set his lance. The knight screamed a challenge as his horse sprang forward, yet the Daemons heeded him not until he was within striking distance.\\n\\nGuided by the Lady, the lance struck the closest Daemon, the knight’s momentum driving the iron tip through the brazen armour. Rage and pain mingled in the bat-winged behemoth’s roar. It swung around to face the knight, dealing Callard a savage blow that sent him tumbling from the saddle onto the altar of the shattered grail chapel.\\n\\nYet, in so doing, the Bloodthirster had turned his back upon his brother Daemon, which now smote him a mighty blow that snapped his spine and cast him to the ruined ground. The axe rose and fell again and again before the wounded creature could recover, each swing marking the walls and weed-strewn flagstones with trails of blood. Eight times the axe rose and fell, and on the eighth stroke the victorious Bloodthirster severed the head of his fallen opponent.\\n	false

As the Bloodthirster threw back its head and bellowed a cry of victory, Callard remembered the slaughtered knights in the valley below, the ruin that had been wrought on Braquiron. Rage flowed into the Baron and with it came fresh courage and strength. The knight hauled himself to his feet and drew the Sword Perilous from its sheath upon the altar.\\n\\nThe anger rose within Callard once again, and the knight embraced it. Lessons in swordplay and fencing fell away like wilted leaves. Canard struck at the monster again and again, with no thought of tactic or finesse, senselessly battering the creature with all the strength he could muster. Impossibly, the injured knight began to prevail, his rage overwhelming his foe’s defences. Callard’s third strike shattered the beast’s left hand, and its barbed lash fell to the ground. His fifth broke the Daemon’s thigh and his seventh near severed a wing.\\n\\nIn desperation the Daemon cast aside its axe. Closing its undamaged taloned hand around the knight’s neck, the Bloodthirster began to throttle its foe. As the creature’s grip tightened, Callard’s vision grew dimmer. He could feel his bones grating under the Daemon’s fearsome grasp and realised he had but seconds to live. With his final breath, Callard thrust the Sword Perilous forward one last time. The gleaming blade penetrated the Bloodthirster’s armour and pierced the creature’s black heart. The Daemon gave a final bellow, and collapsed.\\n\\nOn the other side of the valley, the yeoman warders of Castle Callard cheered as shadows fell from the sky. The curtains of fire that had severed Braquiron from its neighbours vanished, and the wan sunshine returned to the valley. Of the Daemons no trace remained, save for the rank ichor that stained every inch of the town’s ruins.\\n\\nThe Sword Perilous was discovered amid the ruins of the Grail Chapel, its golden finials melted and blackened.

None could be sure of what had occurred in that final battle, but Callard would be remembered as a hero, a knight pure enough of heart to vanquish the greatest of Daemons.\\n\\nDarker tales abound, however.

gen_lore_nor_northern_tribes_subtitle	The Northern Tribes	false
gen_lore_nor_northern_tribes_description	Those who dwell in the northern lands above the Old World are hardy people, typically large of frame and powerfully built. Though barbarous and savage compared to those who dwell in the settled and civilised lands to the south, they are not unlike the Men of the Old World. Thus, in times of peace, traders from the more southerly Norscan and Kurgan tribes can be found hawking their wares in the markets of such cosmopolitan cities as Brionne, Marienburg and Erengrad.\\n\\nYet in other respects the Northmen are a race apart, worshipping the outlandish gods of a monstrous pantheon and living lives that are altogether harsher and more primitive than a citizen of the Old World could imagine. Most importantly, they live within the shadow of the Realm of Chaos and, as such, cannot truly escape its power.\\n\\nIn the civilised southern lands, mutation and disfigurement are commonplace. In the Empire, mutant offspring are quickly abandoned and, in some states, folk showing even the slightest aberration of form are hunted down and burned at the stake by zealous Witch Hunters. But in the far north, such mutations are so common as to be almost universal.\\n\\nThough not always apparent at first glance, most bear the mark of Chaos somewhere upon their bodies. To the people of the north, these are not curses or disfigurements, but blessings bestowed upon them by the gods. Even the most horrific mutations are seen as an irrefutable indication that an individual has been marked by a god – though whether for immortality or oblivion, it is impossible to say.\\n\\nMembers of the innumerable northern tribes tend to wear their hair long, and the men will cultivate thick masses of facial hair. Their skin is tough and ruddy from the fierce caress of the harsh climate and cold winds, even though they habitually protect themselves from the fury of the elements with furs cut from the backs of wolves, bears or the nameless beasts that roam the wilderness.\\n\\nUpon their heavily-thewed arms they wear crude jewellery and sport tangled masses of scar tissue. Many Northmen bear grisly tokens and tattoos that they believe will keep them safe from harm or attract the gaze of the gods. They are usually correct, for those who live on the threshold of the Realm of Chaos are right to be superstitious.\\n\\nThe northern tribes are universally bloodthirsty, barbaric and fierce. They are warrior peoples used to battling amongst themselves, against the weak denizens of the south, and against the other races that have built their empires across the globe. War is their natural state and they wage it with neither prejudice nor malice, rejoicing in battle and strength at arms, honouring the brave of both sides and despising cowards.\\n\\nWhen Chaos is ascendant, the innumerable Marauder tribes of the north are willing to put aside their traditional rivalries and disputes. As word spreads of a coming conflict, the tribes of the Shadowlands gather about their chieftain’s banners and march to war together, under the command of a single, mighty Champion of Chaos, who they will follow to the distant corners of the world in the name of conquest. To the Northmen, there is no greater honour than to fight and perish in the armies of the Ruinous Powers.\\n	false

gen_lore_nor_the_norscans_description	To the immediate north of the Old World live the Norscans: fierce warriors and bold adventurers, hard-bitten and warlike. Norscans are not dissimilar to the folk of the northern provinces of the Empire in appearance, though they are generally held to be taller and stronger than their southern counterparts.\\n\\nTheir mountainous land is haunted by all manner of twisted beasts, notably Trolls, Giants and pallid things that live under the mountains. They are warriors of the sea as well as the land, and enthusiastic traders and adventurers. Thus the Norse sail great distances upon the world’s seas, travelling in sturdily built longships, often called wolfships by those that fall victim to their piracy.\\n\\nAmongst the largest Norscan tribes, the Sarls and Skælings, who dwell in the more temperate, southerly parts of Norsca, are best known as traders and mercenaries. Tribes such as the Vargs, the Kvelligs and the Hastlings who dwell further north, are more influenced by the touch of Chaos.

This cold and barren extension of the great, open steppes is home to the fierce nomadic tribes of the Kurgan. Here, the barbarous and bloodthirsty Marauder tribes are themselves divided into many inter-warring sub-factions.\\n\\nThe Kurgan are a powerfully built race, quite unlike most Old Worlders in appearance. The tribes of the Kurgan, hundreds in number, live a nomadic existence that sees them traverse vast distances in search of prey and in the pursuit of war, and they are said to be equally at home on foot or on horseback. When the armies of Chaos gather to invade the Old World, it is the Kurgan that comprises the bulk, for they are a numerous people compared to the other tribal nations and they feel the call of battle in their blood.\\n\\nThe more southerly Kurgan tribes, such as the Dolgams and Tokmars, are content to coexist with the Ungol tribes of Kislev that dominate the eastern steppes. Warriors of these tribes can often be found fighting alongside the Kislevites as mercenaries in the armies of boyars when not fighting against them in the name of the Ruinous Powers.\\n\\nIt is the warriors of the northernmost Kurgan tribes who are the fiercest and most likely to bear the unnatural gifts of their gods. Amongst the Gharhars and Avags, for example, mutations are commonplace, and those especially blessed are treated with reverence and marked for leadership, or taken in at a young age by the tribes’ sorcerers and shamans to learn the arcane secrets of communing with the gods.\\n	false

Mighty chieftains and aspiring champions vie constantly for power, challenging one another to all manner of martial contests which almost always result in only one of the combatants walking away.\\n\\nAs the influence of the Dark Gods has spread across Norsca, the reward for victory in these duels has become ever more valuable, for not only can a challenger take command of a tribe of warriors, but also earn the attention of the Ruinous Powers themselves.\\n	false

Those who remain make efforts to fortify their settlements, building tall palisades and watchtowers in vain attempts to dissuade the Marauders from returning.

gen_lore_nor_origins_norsca_description	There are many ridiculous beliefs regarding the origins of these people. Some claim they are the spawn of Man and Daemon, creatures whose very nature is at odds with the natural order. Others claim the Norscans are descendants of Giants, kin to the foul creatures of the Ogre Kingdoms. Some have gone so far as to claim Norscans are creatures of snow and ice, as unforgiving as the winter winds. But the truth, as shaded by myth and legend as it is, is far less fantastic.\\n\\nDespite the claims of many Imperial historians, the twelve tribes that would one day form the Empire were not the first men to occupy the Old World. The Tileans, Estalians, Bretonnians, and even the peoples of Araby and ancient Khemri have held portions of what would become the Empire.\\n\\nOther kingdoms rose and fell, leaving behind the ruins of their civilisations. Among these people, there was a race of Humans who held the lands north of the Forest of Shadows, a tribe now called the Norsii. Large, well-formed, and nomadic, they lived from harvesting the bounty of the seas, hunting in the woods, and eating what they could coax from the ground through crude farming techniques. Never populous, they remained content in their lives, worshipping their strange Gods and following stranger customs.\\n\\nThe Norsii’s peace was disturbed when other tribes boiled into the Reik Basin. The worst of these was the tribe called the Teutogens. They were warlike and murderous, and swept across the land like an axe-wielding tidal wave. The Norsii people were forced to take up arms and fight for their lives.\\n\\nAll too quickly, they were pushed back from their lands and forced eastwards into conflict with other tribes, including the Udoses and the Ungols. Many minor conflicts ensued, but, eventually, an uneasy peace descended, and the Norsii settled again; although, this time with weapons ready.\\n\\nOne of the principal difficulties they now faced revolved around the differing religious beliefs. The nearby tribes mostly venerated Ulric and Taal, the Gods of the Teutogens and the Taleutens, while the Norsii worshipped primal forces of blood, death, and, more importantly, their ancestors.\\n\\nThe challenges of their opposing faiths, as well as the Norsii’s savage ways, put them at odds with the other tribes. The land was not big enough for all, so, eventually, a trickle of Norsii began to leave their hunting grounds to find a safe harbour elsewhere in the north.\\n\\nThe Greenskin races had long proved problematic for the people of the Old World. Their constant raiding weakened the tribes of Men, and even troubled the fortress holds of the Dwarfs. When Sigmar emerged as chief of the Unberogen tribe, he brought together twelve other tribes under his banner through diplomacy and war, even conquering the warlike Teutogens. Once united, he led the tribes to face the Orcs and Goblins, and pushed them from his lands. When he was finished, he forged the tribes into a new Empire to bind all to his vision of the future.\\n\\nHowever, not all were content to swear their allegiance to what they saw as a lucky, albeit brave, warlord. Those who would not submit to Sigmar’s rule were forced from the newborn Empire to find homes in other lands.\\n\\nThe remaining members of the Norsii, along with the disaffected members of the other tribes, fled the Empire, heading north. However, these lands were populated by the Ungols, who were not pleased to have refuges in their lands, and forced the fleeing tribesmen further north still, into the frozen, ice-choked mountains; the land now known as Norsca.\\n\\nMore and more people fled to Norsca, and there they found the descendants of the early emigrants who had largely embraced darker aspects of their primitive beliefs. This new land was dangerous and harsh, and the death toll was high from the environment as well as from the depredations by the roaming bands of Kurgan who wandered down from the Chaos Wastes even further north. Added to this new mix of peoples were strange men, believed to be kin to those who were changed into Beastmen in the earliest days of Mankind. It was from this clash of cultures and races that a new people were born: the Norscans.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_shadowed_past_description	The story of the Chaos Dwarfs begins many thousands of years ago during the great expansion of the Dwarf race northwards, long before the rise of Man. The Dwarfs, cleaving to those lands where metal and gems could be found, and firm rock could be delved, principally followed the track of what is now known as the Worlds Edge Mountains.\\n\\nHere they excavated and expanded an under-realm of mighty subterranean fortress-cities linked by countless miles of mine workings and passageways. Eventually this slow but steady expansion led one group of Dwarfs to the uplands in the far north of the Worlds Edge Mountains range they came to know as the “Zorn Uzkul” or the “Great Skull Land” – a vast and inhospitable plateau where the air was frigid and thin, and the dusty ground littered with the wind-scoured bones of the ancient dead.\\n\\nThe mineral wealth was rich here, but the earth and stone to some seemed tainted and unclean. Many Dwarfs called the place accursed and turned aside from it, either retreating to the most established holds, or, if of more adventurous character, choosing to strike out into far Norsca or undertake the journey first east and south to the rich lodes recently discovered in the Mountains of Mourn.\\n\\nSome however, refusing to be baulked, chose to remain in the Great Skull Land come what may. At first these distant Dwarf kindreds retained close ties of kinship and trade, but as the world darkened and foul things crawled from its depths to sunder the Dwarf under-realm, contact between the far flung Dwarf holds became erratic and infrequent, as each looked to their own survival and defence.\\n\\nWhen the Great Time of Chaos descended to sunder the world, these most forlorn of Dwarf kingdoms were lost forever to their kinfolk in the Worlds Edge Mountains, and given up for dead as a tide of horror spilled across the land. The Dwarfs of the West could not have been more mistaken, for the ravages of Chaos did not destroy the hardy, determined Dwarfs of Zorn Uzkul, but instead worked a dreadful change upon them.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_darkling_transformation_description	It is impossible to say with any certainty exactly when the Dwarfs of the East became the malevolent entities now known as the Chaos Dwarfs, as the changes wrought to their bodies and spirits were slow and inexorable. Not even they themselves know the full saga of the dark times of their origins, save for that they were almost utterly destroyed.\\n\\nIt was only by their stubborn refusal to surrender in the face of unspeakable horror and death that they endured – endured and came to know a new patron god, Hashut, Father of Darkness. Slowly they began to increase again in number and restore themselves in power and dark majesty, now barely recognisable from what they had been before.\\n\\nThe Dwarf race is unusually resilient to the warping influence of Chaos – a reflection of natural Dwarf stubbornness, perhaps. Nonetheless, the Dwarfs who live in the shadow of the Mountains of Mourn have changed slowly but inexorably over time, and became twisted in both body and mind. Though they superficially resemble other dwarfs, in all important respects they are easily distinguished.\\n\\nChaos Dwarfs often posses protruding tusks that lend them a brutal, savage expression, and they are commonly grey-fleshed and red of eye. Many have small horns that jut from their forehead and some even have cloven hooves and worse – although such extreme mutations are rare amongst ordinary Chaos Dwarfs and common only among sorcerers and those that have the most direct contact with the stuff of Chaos.\\n\\nIf the influence of Chaos has worked terrifying changes upon the bodies of the Chaos Dwarfs, this is as nothing compared to the transmutation of their hardy Dwarf minds. The traditional Dwarf values of stubborn determination, craftsmanship and industry have been twisted into a perverted mockery in the hearts of the Chaos Dwarfs.\\n\\nThey became pitiless, macabre and cold-hearted creatures, devoid of mercy and consumed by a need to enslave and dominate everyone and everything that came into contact with, and from this need grew their empire. Year upon year, decade upon decade and then century upon century, with malevolent intent and monstrous patience the dominion of the Chaos Dwarfs has slowly grown.\\n\\nDown the centuries, their culture became as corrupted as their minds at every level, from their language and runecraft, to the structure of their clans and their worship – all tainted by Chaos and poisoned by malice, but they are still uniquely dwarfen in many respects: oath and loyalty, grudge and kinship stand as solid as iron, but mercy and weakness are intolerable flaws to be contemptuously destroyed.\\n\\nNot for them the howling anarchy, slaughter and ravening madness of Chaos’ human followers, the unthinking savagery of the Beastmen or even the desperate, labyrinthine intrigues and vicious aggression of the Skaven. Instead, they are consumed with grim, cold cruelty, greed and calculated brutality.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_father_of_darkness_description	The god of the Chaos Dwarfs is Hashut, the Father of Darkness. A grim and malignant being, often represented as a great blazing bull wreathed in smoke and shadow, Hashut is a Chaos god (although some scholars of the arcane would label him as an arch-daemon rather than a dark god, while others insist it is some other form of foul entity let loose upon the world during the Time of Chaos).\\n\\nHashut is closely associated with tyranny, greed, fire and hatred, and it is a being whose gift of power comes at a terrible price. As with much of their origins, just how the Dwarfs of the East came to seal their pact with Hashut remains shrouded in the dark times of the great sundering of the world by Chaos, and in truth the Chaos Dwarfs themselves may have only a dim and warped understanding of how they became bound up with their nightmarish god.\\n\\nThe twisted runic cartouches that adorn their fire-temples do however speak of the abandonment of the Dwarfs of Zorn Uzkul by their Ancestor Gods during the Great Cataclysm, their finding of salvation and succour with their new god and the thirst of Hashut for sacrifice and subjugation in return for his patronage.\\n\\nOver the centuries, in return for flesh and blood, homage and devotion, Hashut has gifted the Chaos Dwarfs with malign secrets and powerful sorcery that fused with their mastery of industry and forgecraft to create many daemon-fused machineries and monstrous engines of war, dominion over the fires of the earth and arcane and malevolent lore that has brutalised their sanity and souls.\\n\\nThe pact between the Chaos Dwarfs and their dark god has only deepened over time and grown to the point where the tendrils of Hashut’s malevolence and the Chaos Dwarfs’ own bitter souls have become as one.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_empire_smoke_blood_ash_description	Chaos Dwarfs are irredeemably evil, bitter and self-centred creatures, caring nothing for the life of others and directing all their labours to the construction of their great city – [[i]]Mingol-Zharr-Naggrund[[/i]] – the City of Fire and Desolation, and the slow expansion of their power and influence in the world. To this end, Chaos Dwarf armies scour the Dark Lands and the deadly realms beyond for slaves to fill their city and labour deep beneath the earth in the pits that surround it, and to provide sacrifices for the furnace fires dedicated to their dark god, Hashut.\\n\\nTheir empire has come to encompass the fire-scorched volcanic plain of Zharrduk at the heart of which Zharr-Naggrund sits, and like a black iceberg, its true extent lies not above with its armoured ziggurats and fire-lanced temples, but below the surface in countless miles of magma-lit delvings, cavernous chambers and vaulted mines which resound to the cries of tortured slaves and the ringing of hammers in an untold number of diabolic forges.\\n\\nFor many miles around it, the Plain of Zharr has succumbed to the hand of the Chaos Dwarfs. It is littered with the scars of vast open mines, fiery rivers of magma, ash dunes and stagnant pools of foaming yellow and blood red – noxious with toxic spoil and fortified workings and watch posts which line the great machine-crushed roads upon which countless slaves haul ore and plunder to feed the ever hungry city of the Chaos Dwarfs.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_slow_burn_description	The plans of the Chaos Dwarfs are the results of the intricate workings of their malign intelligence, deep paranoia and cold cruelty. They see no need to ravage the world in fury in a desperate bid to crush all before them, only to fall overextended and spent, as so many throngs of human marauders and hosts of Greenskin savages have done in the past.\\n\\nInstead, they horde their might slowly and rip from the Dark Lands the mineral wealth it contains in abundance. They venture forth foremost to harvest slaves but also to punish those that would oppose them directly, and sunder any creature or force that might wax powerful in the Dark Lands before it can become a threat.\\n\\nMore rarely do they travel further afield, mounting expeditions into distant lands in search of strange plunder whose worth they have seen in the fires of Hashut’s altars, avenge some slight or merely to callously test their weapons against the powers of the world. As a result of this policy, to many Chaos Dwarfs are at best a dark legend, until they have the misfortune to encounter the dreadful truth for themselves.\\n\\nThe dominion of the Chaos Dwarfs is a slowly expanding power, which has with grinding, calculated savagery carved itself a realm from one of the most deadly lands conceivable, and its masters’ dreams of conquest are things of brooding hatred and bitter perseverance. They are content to see their plans unfold over the course of centuries, perhaps even millennia, until one day all of the world lies a blasted plain in which the Chaos Dwarfs stand unopposed and alone, save for their cowering slaves and the ashen bones of the dead.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_slavery_slaughter_description	Even though their numbers have shown a slow but steady increase down the long centuries in which they have carved their empire from the Dark Lands, the Chaos Dwarfs are still few, and are far outnumbered in their realm by those over who they claim dominion by virtue of might and cruelty – their slaves.\\n\\nThe Chaos Dwarfs consider all life other than that of their own kind to have value only as raw resource and fitting sacrifice, and to them the muscle and sinew, and even the souls of those that bow and scrape at a gesture of their iron-shod hands and cringe before the stroke of their steel-barbed whips are no more than a commodity to be amassed, exploited and spent.\\n\\nWithout slaves, Zharr-Naggrund would not have been built and its vast industries could not be maintained, and even now the need for fresh blood and labour only increases with each passing year and the desolate empire always hungers for more.\\n\\nIf the Chaos Dwarfs’ grand and sepulchral plans bow to any pressure for speed in their execution, it is this increasing need for flesh slaves that is the cause. Should the levels of “livestock” falter through disaster or over use, and are required at the commissioning of any grand new design, the Chaos Dwarf war host is gathered and a suitable target selected for despoil, while simultaneously iron-masked emissaries go out to the tribes of dark-hearted men, Ogres and even Orcs to barter razored steel for lives.\\n\\nThis, in turn, can trigger fresh assaults and ravages far beyond the Dark Lands to meet the Chaos Dwarfs’ tally, and captives taken in distant lands can eventually find their life’s end drudging in the slaver pits of Zharrduk or slaughtered upon its burning altars.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_life_labourer_description	Unfortunate wretches of many races toil amid the poisoned air and burning ash of Zharrduk, and like the craftsmen they are, the Chaos Dwarfs prefer, when possible, to select the “right tool” for the right job – from mutilated Elves flayed and bled to provide alchemical unguents to fettered and broken Chaos beasts from the Northern Wastes harnessed for their immense strength and tolerance for injury.\\n\\nBy far the most common slaves in the Chaos Dwarf realm are Orcs and Goblins, and this is not simply because they are native to the Dark Lands and its bordering mountains, but also because they are hardy creatures who will often last the longest in the noxious fumes and murderous conditions under which they are made to labour.\\n\\nOf these, the Hobgoblins have a unique and favoured place – as much as a slave might be favoured by such cruel and callous masters. Perhaps the most distrusted, vicious and above all treacherous of Goblin kind, the Chaos Dwarfs seldom reduce the Hobgoblins to base toil but rather employ them as slave-overseers, lackeys and even as troops, providing utterly disposable reinforcements for their own forces, enabling a larger enemy army to be weakened without cost in Chaos Dwarf lives before they themselves move in for the kill.\\n\\nHated by the other Greenskins who would happily murder them if they could, the Hobgoblins of the Dark Lands have come to rely on the Chaos Dwarfs for patronage and protection. While they are so treacherously eager to betray each other for advancement, they are quite incapable of fomenting any cohesive rebellion against their brutal masters as they cannot even trust each other! Making them, in some ways, the perfect slaves.\\n\\nHumans too have their place among the slaves of the Chaos Dwarfs, as they are adaptable and quick-witted, albeit less durable than Greenskins and considerably more unpredictable. As do Ogres, who are valued for their raw power but always present a danger as their primitive, violent spirits can never be fully broken.\\n\\nSkaven are never taken alive unless to be worked almost immediately to death or used as paltry mass sacrifices, as they are simply too devious and the Chaos Dwarfs have learned from bitter experience that any group taken might well conceal untold spies, saboteurs and even deliberately infected plague-carriers placed in their midst.\\n\\nBut of all the races to fall into the hands of the masters of Zharr-Naggrund, the darkest fate awaits their kin, the Dwarfs of the West. The fruits of the bitter malice of long, brooding millennia are reserved for the Dawi, and of all sacrifices to Hashut, none are more favoured than those loyal to the treacherous Ancestor Gods.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_black_orcs_description	Certain arcane lore and blasphemous histories state apocryphally that many centuries ago the dark arts of the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers sought to create a new breed of slave by means of blood magic and infernal power. They already, of course, possessed tens of thousands of Orc and Goblin slaves, but at best they were unruly, fractious and inefficient, lacking the useful intelligence of humans or the sheer stamina of Ogres.\\n\\nThe new breed were to be powerful warriors in battle and able workers in the most hostile parts of their benighted realm, inferior to their masters and obedient to their will, but superior in every regard from the common Orc stock from which they were created. The great experiment worked at first, but the Chaos Dwarfs soon came to realise that their new Orc breed, dark-hued and hulking, while both far tougher and stronger than their slave stock, were also far too independently minded to make good slaves.\\n\\nIndeed, their steadiness of will and brutal clarity of purpose compared to common Orcs was itself a dire cause for concern, and not long after their numbers swelled and spread, these “Black Orcs” began to revolt, and even organise other Greenskins into obeying their will rather than that of their Chaos Dwarf masters.\\n\\nSome believe that in “refining” the Black Orcs, the Chaos Dwarfs had also unwittingly concentrated the Orcs’ own bellicose nature and love of battle to untameable heights, while some suggest that something of the arrogant desire to dominate and destroy that festered in the hearts of the Chaos Dwarfs themselves had somehow transferred and taken root in their progeny.\\n\\nIn any case, the Chaos Dwarfs were soon troubled by revolt after revolt, and were beset on all sides by a powerful and deadly enemy of their own creation. In the greatest and final revolt, near-civil war broke out, the Chaos Dwarfs were besieged with their own weapons, and Zharr-Naggrund itself became a battleground.\\n\\nThe Dhrath-Zharr hovered at the precipice of destruction, until aided by the perfidious treachery of the Hobgoblins against their kin. The Black Orcs were finally defeated and cast out and driven from the Chaos Dwarf empire at great cost. The experiment has never been repeated.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_forges_of_hell_description	Chaos Dwarfs are master craftsmen, and their armouries produce an endless stream of armour and weapons, dark devices and works of daemon-fused occult engineering. Much of this wargear, the lesser products of their craft – blades and steel whose quality still outmatches any mere human craftsmanship, is traded northwards to the warring Chaos-touched tribes and eastward to the Ogre Kingdoms in return for slaves, for which the Chaos Dwarfs have an unending demand, rare metals and gems, and to slake whatever strange desires the Sorcerer-Prophet’s experiments might require.\\n\\nBy this trade blood is spilled across the world by their weapons, and in so doing the Chaos Dwarfs both enrich themselves and sow destruction in Hashut’s name, and moreover they spread their insidious influence further, gather intelligence in regards to their enemies and so bring their dreams of dominion closer, one drop of shed blood at a time.\\n\\nThe greater works of their hell-forges and the spawn of the dark intellect of their sorcerers, however, they guard jealously for themselves, and it is on the bedrock of these malevolent engines, savage weapons and brutal sorcery that the Chaos Dwarfs’ true power is founded. Chaos Dwarf warriors are themselves equipped to the highest standard and every Sorcerer Lord arms and outfits their soldiers to their own design and in their own distinctive livery.\\n\\nThe majority of their troops are armed with masterfully crafted axes, vicious stabbing blades and barbed war-picks, and protected by heavy scale corselets of rune-hardened iron or bronze, tall helmets and heavy, metal-clad shields. The most potent wear so-called blackshard armour, forged with hellfire and blood, stronger than mere steel and phenomenally resistant to the effects of fire and heat.\\n\\nA significant number of troops are armed with firearms, from intricate wheel-lock pistols to the heavy, bladed fireglaive repeating guns. But the hailshot blunderbuss – a powerful, short-ranged weapon whose murderous fire is amplified when used in rank fusillade – is the most common and iconic.\\n\\nThis last weapon was developed to combat the near-limitless Orc and Goblin hordes that abound in the lands around the Chaos Dwarfs’ domain and has become the terror of the Greenskins in battle, able to blunt even their crushing charges and slaughter scores of howling Goblins in a single, thunderous blast from the warriors’ ranks.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_war_machines_woe_description	It is for their war machines that the Chaos Dwarfs have become the most infamous and dreaded on the battlefield. Unfettered by the usual Dwarf reliance on tradition and resistance to change, they have combined their intellect and sophisticated understanding of steam power and mechanism with the hellish lore of Hashut to produce a nightmarish array of weapons.\\n\\nThese range from cannons that fire burning gouts of magma, to steam-driven reapers, to fortress-shattering mortars and colossal siege engines of glittering brass. The most terrible of these war machines are bound with hungering daemons in their fabric, granting them both an unholy semblance of life and unmatched killing power.\\n\\nThe might and bloodlust of these hell-forged artefacts cannot be denied, and they are perilous even to their masters should their occult bindings shake loose. As a result of their unpredictability and the difficulty of their construction, hell-bound war engines are used and fashioned more sparingly than more conventional (although no less deadly) designs in the Chaos Dwarf arsenal.\\n\\nSuch weapons are often “tested” in battle by a pact of alliance with the Chaos Warriors of the north, so long as it serves the Dhrath-Zharr’s purpose, and it is not uncommon to see small contingents of dreaded Chaos Dwarf war machines amid the ranks of the war bands and hordes of the Chaos Wastes, lending them their immense destructive power.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_curse_stone_description	The sorcerers of the Chaos Dwarfs pay a terrible price for their powers, be they Hellsmith or mighty prophet of their dark god Hashut, as their bones and flesh slowly petrify over time into unfeeling, blackened stone. Each time the magic they command slips from their grasp for but an instant, the curse punishes them further, until one day the sorcerer is trapped, screaming silently within a prison of their own immobile body.\\n\\nDwarfs were never meant to wield the magic of Chaos, and each dread spell they cast brings them one step closer to petrification. The curse starts with their feet, which turn grey and useless, before progressing throughout the rest of their body.\\n\\nThough some learned Sorcerer-Prophets have found methods to slow the curse, none have halted it completely, and the most ancient among them must resort to using their sorcerous engineering to graft steam-driven appendages to their inert limbs so they can retain some degree of function. Inevitably, however, they succumb, and their petrified forms are left to line the road leading to Zharr-Naggrund.\\n	false

gen_lore_chd_machines_madness_massacre_description	In the creation of arms and diabolic engines of destruction, the Chaos Dwarfs of Zharr-Naggrund have no equal in the world save perhaps for the Skaven of Clan Skryre. Aside, however, from the superficial similarity of their desire to create ever more powerful devices, the approach and means to an end for the Chaos Dwarfs and the Skaven could not be further apart.\\n\\nWhere the Chaos Dwarfs favour craftsmanship and reliability over mere speed of creation, the Skaven care not for such considerations in favour of raw power and getting the device in operation as quickly as possible, however unpredictable the result or potentially fatal it is to the crew. To this end, the Skaven favour the use of the treacherous and potent Warpstone in their works, which while not unknown to the Chaos Dwarfs, they favour the arcane binding of Daemons through the sorcerous lore of Hashut in their most powerful devices instead.\\n\\nThe end result can sometimes be no less dangerous to the Hellsmith or crewman called upon to direct such a weapon, but to the minds of Chaos Dwarfs, such calamity that may result will be caused by the result of weakness or ill-discipline by the operator, or the will of Hashut, rather than chance volatility or shoddy workmanship.\\n\\nThis is not to say that one side has not kept a weather eye on the inventions of the other, or indeed sought to steal their secrets from the wreckage strewn on the battlefield, but such is the idiosyncrasies and inherent dangers in the two entirely alien approaches that seldom has more than disaster and madness resulted from the attempts on either side.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_tribes_beyond_number_description	All Orcs and Goblins live in tribes – squabbling groups of warriors that fight under a single leader. A tribe is made up of different mobs, with each mob containing Greenskins of the same type; Orc mobs, Goblin mobs, Black Orc mobs, and so on.\\n\\nFor example, the Headsplittaz tribe is led by Nagrat Eyegouger. It is composed of many mobs, each one named after its Boss, deeds or favoured weapons. The Red Axes, Gutstabbas and Brok’s Boyz are Orc mobs, while Griblet’s Stickas are a mob of Goblin archers.\\n\\nAll march beneath the Headsplittaz banner and take orders, however begrudgingly, from Nagrat. Greenskins take great pride in both their tribe and mob, feeling that they are `da best’, while all others are weedy and knock-kneed.\\n\\nTribes range in size from a few hundred individuals to vast hordes. The most important member of a tribe is its leader, generally known as a Warboss, although other terms, like Great ‘Ead-kicker, Chieftain or Grand Thumpa, are also used. It takes an impressive Greenskin to lead a tribe and only the loudest and strongest ever rise to such a level. A dose of low cunning is also useful, particularly amongst goblinoids.\\n\\nA tribe’s success is directly linked to its Warboss, and all admire a leader for his ability to push an opponent’s nose through his brainpan. A second-rate Warboss won’t last long – his tribe will collapse due to in-fighting, fall victim to a better-led group, or the Warboss will have his head bashed in by an up-and-coming challenger.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_natural_violent_order_description	Orcs and Goblins are often encountered together in the same tribe. This is the natural order of Greenskin life – the strong ruling over the weak. The more powerful Orc mobs are only too eager to include Goblins, as this gives them someone to boss about and the ‘runts’ are easily bullied into doing the most unpleasant chores.\\n\\nAs Orcs despise almost everything except fighting, Goblins do all the mundane jobs around camp, such as gathering fuel for fires, erecting crude huts and digging out ‘da dropz’ (the Greenskin latrines). In return for their work, Goblins gain the protection of their larger kin, despite suffering constant kicks and cuffs as the Orcs flout their dominance.\\n\\nWhile the lowliest Goblins suffer as a slave-class, the more wily amongst their number can learn to manipulate their somewhat dimmer kin. It is well known that Grubbit Legbiter, a Goblin considered wickedly cunning even by his own kind, is the mastermind that plans the raids of the Broken Tooth tribe, even though that tribe is primarily composed of Orc mobs and ruled by the formidably large Orc Warboss Urk da Stuntystompa.\\n\\nBeyond the natural dominance of strong over weak, there is little semblance of order in a Greenskin tribe. Things constantly change and often do so in a hurry. The wilds in which most tribes live are dangerous places, subject to attack by all manner of foes and monsters, including other Orcs and Goblins.\\n\\nTribes alter constantly as old mobs leave to seek their own way, new mobs join and Warbosses fall as stronger challengers rise up to take over. It has been said that, should all the Orcs and Goblins of the world unite, they would soon conquer every other race; but Greenskin tribes are fractious and would much rather fight each other for dominance than cooperate for some greater campaign against a distant enemy.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_their_own_worst_enemy_subtitle	Their Own Worst Enemy	false
gen_lore_grn_their_own_worst_enemy_description	When there is no enemy to focus their aggression on, Orcs and Goblins spend an inordinate amount of time fighting each other. This means tribes that emerge from the constant culling are the biggest and strongest, the most cunning, or at least the fastest (running away being a popular Goblin option).\\n\\nTribes grow when they conquer smaller ones, as most often the winners slay all the opposing commanders and force the remaining warriors to join their tribe. At other times the process of ‘absorbing’ the smaller tribe is much more literal, with the winners actually eating the vanquished tribe.\\n\\nHow the defeated are dealt with depends on many factors, from how hungry the victors are, to how well the opposition fought, or some other, more mysterious whim of the Warboss. For example, Orc Warboss Grizgrod, the famed leader of the Itchy Scabs tribe, never forgave a Stone Troll for eating the foot of his lucky Shaman, Zog.\\n\\nWhen the Itchy Scabs conquered swathes of territory in the Worlds Edge Mountains, an area rife with Trolls, Grizgrod (encouraged by ‘Pegleg’ Zog) refused to let any Stone Trolls join the ranks of the Itchy Scabs. They were instead driven off cliffs, sealed into tunnels or burnt from afar with flaming arrows.\\n\\nWarriors that have been recently recruited into a new tribe will try to fit in, often adapting some of the common colours, symbols or icons of their new group, although some mobs retain a semblance of their old allegiance. For instance, all members of the Blue Face tribe bear (as one might expect) blue paint or dye upon their faces. However, many of the Blue Face mobs still carry symbols or tokens from previous tribes, be it the stained shafts of the Bloody Spear tribe or the spider symbols favoured by many Forest Goblin mobs.\\n\\nThe wide variety of Greenskins, and general disdain for hygiene, gives most Greenskin tribes a disparate and ragtag appearance. Savage Orcs in outlandish warpaint (and little else) can form up beside flea-bitten Wolf Riders, while the disciplined and well-armoured Black Orc mobs will fight side-by-side with mad, cackling Night Goblins. This kind of muddled disorder is exacerbated during a large Waaagh!, when many tribes trek great distances to join the throng.\\n\\nFor as long as the promise of great bloodshed and plunder remains, any friction between even the most outlandish coalition of disparate tribes is mere inconvenience – a series of good ol’ scraps producing few casualties. However, should the Greenskins suffer defeat or face any prolonged period of inactivity, the hostility between rival mobs or tribes will most likely tear any hope of future cooperation to shreds. Only a truly masterful Warboss has the willpower, might and low cunning to keep such self-destructive tendencies under control for long!\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_brute_aggression_subtitle	Brute Aggression	false
gen_lore_grn_brute_aggression_description	The composition of Orc tribes is wide-ranging and diverse. For example, Narg Crookfang, Warboss of the Dead Eye Orc tribe, favours softening his foe up with war machine fire and sticking them with lots of arrows before sending in the infantry. His Orc mobs are backed up by Goblin archers and he insists his tribe drag Rock Lobbers wherever they travel. Conversely, the Skullsplittas Orc tribe has no truck with ‘panzie shooty stuff’. Instead their chieftain callously orders Night Goblins to screen the advance of his Orc mobs. This works well, although periodically the Skullsplittas have to raid the mountains to recruit more Night Goblins.\\n\\nRegardless of their composition, Orc tribes are formed around a hard-fighting core of Orcs. These can be infantry mobs (known as ‘da Boyz’) or boar-riding cavalry (known as Boar Boyz). They are often joined by a flotsam of others, including Savage Orc or Black Orc mobs, goblinoids and, if there are any about, Trolls and Giants. Most Warbosses aren’t too picky about who joins the tribe; after all, they’ll be slain or eaten pretty quickly if they aren’t up to snuff.\\n\\nSome of the larger Orc tribes, like the Ironclaw, Broken Tooth and Red Fang tribes, are well known even beyond their own stomping grounds. Orcs in particular feel that an impressive reputation is worth fighting for and, naturally, do so often. While many tribes are absorbed or totally destroyed, some particularly famous ones, like the Ironclaw Orcs, eventually come back. Inspired by an old legend chanted about by a trance-addled Shaman, a Warboss will raise the standard of a long-silenced tribe.\\n\\nOn occasion an Orc tribe will actually be made up solely out of Boyz mobs or, rarer still, almost entirely Boar Boyz. With no Goblins to beat indiscriminately, Orcs are left to sort out their own menial tasks. This makes the always belligerent Orcs angrier still, and full-on fights break out in Orc-only camps with alarming regularity.\\n\\nThese struggles determine the pecking order, with the lowliest warriors doing all the work, while the victors loll about. No Orc can bear to chop trees, skin beasts or endure any non-violent or productive task for very long, so fights continually break out even after all the work has been assigned.\\n\\nThis environment ensures that Orc-only tribes are small, but very battle-hardened. It also means their camps lack even the crude amenities that enforced Goblin labour normally provides, such as simple skin huts, stockades to fence in the boars or any ‘propa place to do yer business’.\\n\\nAmongst Orcs, legends or tribal traditions that capture their limited imaginations tend to make for the most popular mob and tribe names. Not surprisingly, these are menacing names that promise violence, such as the Bonebreakaz, Skull Smashaz or Face-stompas. Orcs have been known to go to war over who gets the naming rights for a tribe. Then again, Orcs will go to war over pretty much anything.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_iron_hard_angry_description	The origins of the Black Orcs are shrouded in mystery, but it is assumed that they gain their name from their dark green or even black skin. They are the largest and most ferocious of their warlike kind, which is really saying something.\\n\\nBlack Orcs are exceedingly militaristic, which isn’t always a good thing, as other Greenskins find such rigour off-putting. Other Orcs feel that marching, drilling and taking care of wargear is distinctly un-Orcish behaviour. Even worse, the Black Orcs insist on lugging about a great profusion of weapons, feeling that a few spare choppas are a necessity at all times.\\n\\nBlack Orcs like bossing others about even more than Orcs do, except that Black Orcs bellow to instil discipline instead of provoking rivals. Grim and humourless, Black Orcs have no patience for the in-fighting that is so rampant amongst the rest of Greenskin kind.\\n\\nDespite being killjoys around any Greenskin camp, Black Orcs are great fighters. Luckily for the civilised world, Black Orcs are also the most rare of Orcish kind. In most Greenskin tribes, if they are found at all, Black Orcs are encountered as hard-fighting elite units or as leaders.\\n\\nAn infamous Black Orc Warbosses is Morglum Necksnapper, a powerful fighter who has led his mob from the desolate East to conquer many Orc & Goblin tribes around the Worlds Edge Mountains. Those who fight hard enough (and survive) are allowed to join the Necksnappers, a still-growing horde that has won many famous victories.\\n\\nThere are tribes composed almost entirely of Black Orcs, although these are rarely seen outside of the Dark Lands. On the occasions when they cross westwards to invade the Old World, it always heralds the start of a long and bloody Waaagh!\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_wild_fury_description	Savage Orcs are primitive Greenskins who have chosen to stick with old traditions and shun such ‘new’ developments as metal weapons, body armour or the wearing of boots. It is common to find a few mobs of Savage Orcs fighting for Orc or Goblin tribes.\\n\\nIt is easy to pick out such mobs, as Savage Orcs favour distinctive warpaint or full body tattoos, and practise unusual customs like piercing parts of their bodies with sharpened bones. Their unusual appearance, Shaman-led rituals and superstitious nuances often earn Savage Orcs ridicule from other Greenskins.\\n\\nIt is easy to be ostracised by others when you only wear loincloths. For these reasons Savage Orc mobs stick to themselves in camp. Once battle begins, however, Savage Orcs fight with a ferocity that more than earns them the right to whatever oddities their Shaman can dream up – even the embarrassing bat-flapping dance.\\n\\nBecause their ways are so simplistic, there are many tribes made up primarily, if not exclusively, of Savage Orcs. In these groups they can practice their drum-thumping, bone-shaking rituals free of scorn. Even Giants that latch onto such savage tribes are given a fresh coat of warpaint come battle time.\\n\\nThe hunting grounds of these tribes are often found in some wild or remote region of the world. The Top-knotz tribe, famous for their bone-pierced coifs and their shields made of Giant Razorclam shells, stalk the coastal region of the Black Gulf.\\n\\nThe Boneclubs and their rivals, the Snakeskinz tribe, dominate the steaming jungles of the Southlands. Some, like the Headhuntaz tribe, are widely nomadic. They are led on winding paths by their Shamans, guided by inner voices and the very will of the Greenskin gods. Or so they say.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_wicked_green_hordes_description	Goblins, sometimes called ‘gobbos’, are the most numerous of Greenskins, and their tribes can show a lot of variation due to regionalisation or culture. While many Goblin mobs are subjugated under Orcs, there are plenty of Goblin tribes about.\\n\\nTo avoid Orc rule, some Goblins take to living in harsh environments – after all, there just aren’t that many Orcs willing to live deep in a swamp, and many Goblin tribes thrive in such locales. A Goblin Warboss of greater-than-usual craftiness can turn the tables and rule over mixed tribes containing Orc mobs, although such situations tend to be rare or spectacularly short-lived.\\n\\nSome of the most famous all-Goblin forces have stemmed from the Wolf Rider tribes. These roaming groups use the superior speed of their wolf mounts to dominate swathes of open plains or steppes. Even Ogre bands are hesitant to cross such wide spaces due to the hit-and-run prowess of the Wolf Riders.\\n\\nOrc tribes highly value Wolf Rider mobs and seek to recruit them for use as far-ranging scouts. In other environments, marsh-dwelling gobbos (sometimes called Bog-Goblins or Boggarts) are wily ambushers who are known to waylay anyone foolish enough to enter their morass-like lairs.\\n\\nFrom the deep woods emerge Forest Goblins, fierce raiders that launch lightning assaults before melting back into the arboreal depths. Forest Goblins are distinctive in that they wear brightly coloured feathers, worship the Spider-god and ride spiders into battle.\\n\\nOther well-known Goblin tribes include nomadic traders that travel the wilderness in ramshackle, fortress-like caravans. They trade with all kinds of unsavoury types and, unsurprisingly, are known for their thievery and swindling skills.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_spite_from_below_description	Long ago, Goblin tribes took to living in the many caves that worm beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. Perhaps it was their long exposure to the strange fungus that grows there or the lack of daylight, but for whatever reason they evolved into a distinct sub-species – the Night Goblin.\\n\\nThey have become expert tunnellers and are at home underground. They wear long, hooded black robes, partially to blend in with their darksome surroundings, but mostly to ensure that the hated light of the sun never touches them when they foray to the surface.\\n\\nNight Goblins tend to be slightly scrawnier and even more cowardly than their surface-dwelling kin. Night Goblins are the most maniacal of Greenskins; their massed mobs are given to sporadic bouts of cackling and gibbering.\\n\\nSome individuals are even more psychotic, as only the most deranged of creatures would dare consume a madcap mushroom – an act that turns a Night Goblin into a deadly whirlwind of destruction. Equally hazardous is the practice of herding Cave Squigs, the kind of beast that any sane race would exterminate, not keep as pets or even mounts.\\n\\nWith their penchant for infesting underground strongholds to live in, the Night Goblins have established themselves as arch enemies of other subterranean races, particularly the ratmen known as Skaven and the proud Dwarfs. Due to the long-standing enmity between Dwarfs and Night Goblins, the two races are implacable foes and will often fight to the death rather than give ground. Night Goblins occasionally emerge from below to raid the surface world for food or slaves, or to join in a larger Waaagh! for the chance to gain loot and cause mayhem in the surface world.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_bloody_history_description	Some races record their history, preserving for posterity the great deeds of the past. In the histories of Men, Elves and Dwarfs the Greenskins appear, but only during their largest and most spectacularly bloody invasions.\\n\\nFor their own part, Orcs and Goblins don’t care about history. Their only version of it is the campside tales told by their Shamans. Greenskins like hearing about bloodshed and great victories, although they need lots of gory details to hold their limited attention span.\\n\\nA Shaman can rouse some interest with inspired bits of pantomime brawling, but more powerful Shamans go a step further, working themselves into a trance while describing battles of long ago. They assume manifold voices, and ghostly green images project above their furrowed brows.\\n\\nThese vivid magical effects allow onlookers to witness the carnage and to hear the sounds of battle, and the thrill of the spectacle provides the Shaman with more power. In this way, Greenskin history is kept alive (at least the victorious battle scenes anyway – no Orc likes a loser).\\n\\nThe Shamans themselves remember little of such episodes, simply saying they were travelling in ‘da Great Green’. Whether they are reporting back events as they actually happened long ago, tapping into some racial memory or simply focusing the violent thoughts of their comrades is unknown. Greenskins find such projections exciting and a Shaman who can show such glorious battles provides entertainment around camp that is rivalled only by pit-fights, Goblin-invented torture games or watching a Giant play a match of Dwarf Skittles.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_orcs_description	Orcs vary in size, but all pack a great deal of muscle, bone and few brains into a green, hairless body as tall as a man, but substantially broader. They have thick skulls, elongated jaws and tusk-like teeth. An Orc’s protruding brow partially conceals his glowering eyes, which blaze red when he is angry – most of the time, in fact.\\n\\nTheir tough green hides vary in shade depending on age or even climate. They are brutes and louts of the first degree, insensitive to pain (and higher thought). Orcs single-mindedly pursue what they want, and what Orcs want most is to fight. If there are no enemies immediately to hand, the overly belligerent Orcs will readily scrap amongst themselves.\\n\\nIn battle, Orcs form units called mobs, which are led by the biggest of their kind, the Bosses. The right to lead an Orc mob is earned by defeating the current Boss in a challenge. Such violent confrontations are both plentiful and important in Orc society (if it can be termed as such).\\n\\nMight equals right for Greenskins and in-fighting is how Orcs ensure that their leaders are the largest and most ferocious of their mob. After all, bigger is always better and being able to bash an opponent’s head in spectacularly is a clear sign of leadership amongst such brutal kind. This is true for all Orcs, including the Savage Orcs, primitive throwbacks to more primeval days, and the Black Orcs, the largest and most formidable of all the Orcish races.\\n	false

gen_lore_grn_goblins_description	Contrasting strongly with their thuggish Orc cousins, Goblins are small, scrawny and nimble. Their skin is a brighter shade of green than an Orc and they have large noses, wickedly pointed teeth and glinting, beady eyes. Goblins are by far the more sneaky and intelligent of the two races.\\n\\nWhile Orcs communicate sparingly, largely using scowls and grunts, Goblins are garrulous with irritating high-pitched voices. Unlike most Orcs, Goblins are prone to acts of extreme cowardice. However, when the odds are heavily stacked in their favour, Goblins greatly enjoy bullying and cruelty, and they can be every bit as aggressive as their larger kin. Vicious and mean-spirited, Goblins prefer to attack from behind or assail already weakened foes.\\n\\nGoblins adapt to the lands they live in, and this produces a variety of cultural differences, from the spider-worshipping Goblins of the deep forests to the nomadic, fur clad Wolf Riders of the plains. Despite their differences, they are all are the same breed.\\n\\nThere are a few distinct subspecies of Goblins, although only one is tolerated by other Orcs and Goblins – the Night Goblins. So long have they dwelt in the tunnels beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains that these Goblins have developed into a unique, sun-hating species, especially prone to madness and cowardice.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_ogres_subtitle	Ogres	false
gen_lore_ogr_ogres_description	Ogres are large, loud creatures that go out of their way to make a formidable impression. Even in a violent world used to constant warfare, it is hard not to be in awe of a creature that can smash a man’s ribs and send him flying through the air with a single swipe of an iron-bound club. Though if raw strength alone isn’t enough to cause a stir, the sight of an Ogre reaching out a meaty hand to lift up and consume his recently broken victim in great, greedy bites is sure to register horror in all but the boldest of hearts.\\n\\nThe first thing anyone notices about Ogres is how big they are. A full-grown Ogre stands nearly twice as tall as a man and several times as wide. Those who deal with Ogres find they chiefly exhibit two distinct expressions – that of glum intimidation and a sinister grin, which is far worse.\\n\\nAside from rancid meat-breath that can startle a Dwarf sober, Ogres have flat, overlapping teeth that are unusually strong – they can bite through the bark of a sturdy Drakwald Oak as easily as if it was the skin of a roast chicken. When an Ogre grins, it has little to do with mirth and everything to do with showing the victim what is going to happen next.\\n	false
gen_lore_ogr_guts_glory_title	The Ogre Kingdoms	false
gen_lore_ogr_guts_glory_subtitle	Guts and Glory	false
gen_lore_ogr_guts_glory_description	There is little that Ogres cannot eat, and their large guts attest to this. To Ogres, a gut is of utmost importance to its owner – socially, physically and even spiritually. Not only are an Ogre’s vital organs situated deep within his belly, but the gut is also a status symbol that declares wealth and power.\\n\\nThe largest and most impressive guts belong to the Tyrants, the leaders and tribal kings that rule large groups of Ogres. All Ogres protect their innards with a large, circular “gutplate” worn over the protrusion. These are usually made of metal beaten into shape, but poor Ogres are known to use hide-skins, cast off cart wheels, or even ones made of bone.\\n\\nWhile Ogres are undeniably fat, underneath all that blubber resides massive slabs of pure muscle. Their thick arms end in great ham-fisted hands that wield large clubs with lethal ease. An Ogre’s legs are stout and tireless, all the better to carry such a lumpen frame.\\n\\nWith thick skin as resilient as cured leather, Ogres can survive cold environments and are extremely tough, able to shrug off minor wounds. For this reason, only the richest and most elite Ogres bother with armour beyond their gut-plates and instead stride to battle bare-chested. It is common amongst many tribes to tattoo themselves or daub themselves with warpaint, although, as Ogres are not hygienic in the least, it is hard to distinguish what is a tribal marking and what is post-dinner gristle.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_might_makes_right_description	A lone Ogre is capable of besting a dozen men in a fight and a dozen Ogres can overwhelm a village of men and eat the better half of its defenders. A whole army of Ogres, however, is something else altogether.\\n\\nEach Ogre regiment is a sweaty, bellowing mass that builds up fearsome momentum that slams home like a ton of bricks. An army is made up of many such regiments and it hits like an avalanche – a great, sweeping wave of crushing destruction. But Ogres do not stomp to war by themselves, they bring with them lumbering cave creatures, hairy and long-tusked monsters from the wild mountains, and all manner of ferocious beasts.\\n\\nThe reason Ogres find warfare so much to their liking is that as they crush and conquer their way across the land, they can seize everything they need to survive, and more to spare. Where does an army full of ten-foot tall, musclebound monsters go? The answer, naturally, is “wherever it wants”. So Ogre armies, led by the largest and most ferocious of their kind, trudge the world, seeking riches and endless supplies of fresh meat. And no matter how much food or loot they seize, it never satisfies them for long.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_crude_ingenuity_description	Ogres are not great builders – learned scholars describe them as “thick as two short planks”, although they do also note that Ogres can beat nearly anything to death with two such planks. Rumour has it that by putting an ear close to an Ogre’s head, it is possible to hear the ocean.\\n\\nThis, however, seems unlikely speculation, a no one in their right mind would dare to put his ear that close to such a ravenous creature’s mouth. It is true that most Ogres are somewhat dim and as a race do not invent things or create anything of beauty or lasting worth. However, they do have success cobbling things together out of scrap materials.\\n\\nOgre clubs are an example of the race’ crude ingenuity, for although they are blunt instruments that are simple in design and function, they are all “improved” by their bearers. Some are topped with rocks or curved blades, or strengthened with chains.\\n\\nOther clubs have their “sweet spot” – the part that hits with the greatest force – enhanced with bound iron, knobby metal protrusions or even the teeth of one of the many enormous monsters that Ogres like to hunt. To use a mere unadorned tree bough in battle would be a bit embarrassing.\\n\\nThese simple upgrades are indicative of all Ogre-built items, from their machines of war to the skin huts they set up at their camps. The Ogres’ quick and ready ability to use natural resources, mixed with whatever scrap or war detritus is on hand, has come from their roving ways and the inhospitable terrain in which they periodically settle. \\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_wanderers_far_wide_description	Ogres are restless creatures, and their tribes are nomadic – ready to move camp at the drop of a well-gnawed bone. Ogres often wander far from their homelands, and when their armies are on the move, they leave behind them a trail of wreckage and little else.\\n\\nThe great crump-crump-crump sound of an Ogre army on the march is not a welcome one, for they will attack and plunder any settlement they come across. In this manner, armies resupply on the move, consuming any who are foolish enough to stay to defend their homes, and then devouring all the livestock and anything else that looks vaguely edible.\\n\\nAny meat not devoured immediately is carried off, so Ogres and their enormous war beasts are often seen with huge haunches of meat and unplucked rib cages tied to their bodies. As dangerous as a tribe on the march is, a halted tribe is even worse...\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_taking_heavy_toll_description	The Ogres establish their camp by erecting flea-ridden hide tents and digging out a massive ceremonial pit in the camp’s centre. Then it’s time to “get down to business” – and business, for Ogres, means either intimidating others into giving them food, or waging war to take what they want.\\n\\nLookouts are posted along roads, mountain passes or other obvious travel routes and a toll is exacted upon any thoroughfare, those who can’t pay are eaten. Ultimatums demanding steep tithes are delivered to nearby settlements.\\n\\nMost Ogres these days are sophisticated enough to demand payment in either gold or in food stock, although some tribes are stuck in the old ways and have not yet learned the value of monetary systems. Any that refuse to pay are dealt with swiftly, the Ogre Tyrant ordering an all-out attack to crush them wholesale.\\n\\nTo stave off their own destruction, many of the oppressed willingly hand over herd animals to the demanding Ogres. Sometimes, especially with the more unscrupulous races, a settlement will betray a portion of their own population to avoid a hopeless battle against the Ogres.\\n\\nOgres excel in their role as aggressive bullies, and they are demanding during negotiations. As most Ogres are not especially bright, they can be duped, but only the very slowest can be caught out by the same trick twice.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_brutal_practicality_subtitle	A Brutal Practicality	false
gen_lore_ogr_brutal_practicality_description	Ogres are straightforward, being wholly untroubled by such things as morality or worries over questions of good or evil. If Ogres can get what they want (food and wealth) without fighting, they will do so, but if it’s more advantageous to annihilate and eat their opposition, then so be it.\\n\\nOgres go about their business with little or no malice and, although far from bright, they have an uncanny business-like sense to recognise if their victims are worth more alive than dead. It is a plum situation to have nearby villagers pay a tithe of livestock every cycle of the moon in order to prevent an Ogre attack. Over time, such arrangements pay more than if the Ogres had descended en masse and eaten the whole lot.\\n\\nParticularly successful tribes have many tithes on the go at once, meaning a rich stream of food pours into their camp without them lifting a pudgy finger. At one point, after settling in the Badlands, the Ogres of the Thunderguts tribe were collecting bounties from six Greenskin tribes, as well as a hefty payment from the fretful men on the other side of the Blood River. Should a deal go bad, such as when funds are short or double-dealing is detected, the Ogres have no qualms about making a bloody example out of anyone.\\n\\nIn battle, Ogres form large battle lines and surge towards the foe, moving with a speed that belies their lumbering forms. Ogres wade into an attack with the same gusto they show when eating, and they are proficient fighters that excel in the use of bludgeoning weapons, such as clubs, hammers and even their massive bodies.\\n\\nA backhanded swipe from such a brute has enough force to break a horse’s back, and a single charging Ogre can smash a shield wall asunder. If their initial impact does not scatter a foe, Ogres will press on in the grind of close combat. With their great size and thick skin, Ogres can soak up a lot of punishment too, as they are as tough as their mountainous homes – indeed, fighting Ogres is like battling a landslide.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_large_and_in_charge_subtitle	Large and in Charge	false
gen_lore_ogr_large_and_in_charge_description	Ogres have lived in tribes since their earliest days on the plains. These bands allow Ogres to take what they want, whether in battle or on the hunt, as few can stand against a bulky wall of oncoming Ogres. A tribe can range in size from a few dozen individuals to larger groups comprising many hundreds. Yet regardless of a tribe’s size, it is organised according to a recognisable hierarchy and follows proud Ogre traditions.\\n\\nTo ensure their tribe stays strong, any weak or gangly offspring are weeded out by throwing them into the caves as offerings to the Great Maw. It is a grim but practical outlook, for Ogres require a lot of food and only those strong enough to hunt or fight can survive.\\n\\nTribe leaders are known as Tyrants and are the biggest and most dominant individuals. They naturally rise to rule and do so with an iron fist (literally, for Ogres commonly wear bladed gauntlets just for this purpose). The next largest Ogres under the Tyrant are known as Bruisers, and these contenders for tribal power assume lesser command duties.\\n\\nDissension within a tribe (or without for that matter) is handled with sudden and predictable violence, and any who question a Tyrant’s decisions must be prepared to fight the leader in a match to the death. Before such a duel, each Ogre removes his gut-plate – an ominous sign, as the victor in such a contest is expected to feast on the guts of the loser. Ogres refer to this traditionally as a “guts out” challenge.\\n\\nAscension to tribal rule is not hereditary – all an Ogre has to do is to defeat the current Tyrant. As the most powerful Ogres tend to sire the strongest offspring, a Tyrant’s fiercest challenges come from his own progeny.\\n\\nThus begets a generational cycle of violence where a Tyrant eventually faces his most ambitious son in a challenge, and to remain as ruler, he must beat down and eat his own rebellious offspring, or be eaten in turn. Ogres being what they are, find this normal and speak proudly of relatives who put up a good showing.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_absolute_violence_description	Ogre Tyrants are bullies of the first degree and unleashing abrupt violence helps them keep an iron rule over their tribe. A common tradition amongst Tyrants is to pull a limb or two off anyone who offends them – such as those who speak too much or any Ogre that accidently eats one of the Tyrant’s favourite Gnoblars.\\n\\nThe commonly used phrase “that will cost an arm and a leg” stems from this practice. The arms or legs in question are most often eaten, but some Tyrants use them to bludgeon the offender.\\n\\nThe Ogre Tyrant Malbob Mountainsmasher even earned the name “Bigarm” after pulling a Giant’s arm out during a friendly dispute. From that day on, Malbob used the massive limb as a club. Until it started to go off, that is... then he ate it.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_hunters_of_legend_description	Hunters are mysterious figures that occasionally turn up in camps hauling beasts of prodigious proportions. Naturally, they become figures of awe to many Ogres and tales of famous Hunters are popular.\\n\\nThe most famous Hunter is Jhared Longstrider, the Huntfather. Jhared was cast out of his tribe as a whelp due to the pelt of red fur that covered him. Refusing to die in the wilds, Jhared was adopted and raised by a pack of Sabretusks, which accompanied him until the end of his days.\\n\\nJhared’s exploits included slaying the tribe that ousted him, stampeding an entire herd of Ice Mammoths off the Cliffs of Ruin and being the first to capture and ride a Mournfang beast. Many Hunters continue to tame their own Sabretusks, although unlike Jhared, most use heavy clubs to do so.\\n\\nCrobat One-and-a-halfwit was an Ogre Hunter who slew many famous beasts, although he is perhaps best remembered for something else. After destroying a Goblin raiding party, Crobat kept the bolt thrower that wounded him as a souvenir. He learned to fire it from the hip, and so the first harpoon launcher was created.\\n	false

gen_lore_ogr_rhinox_ogre_beast_burden_description	The Rhinox is a hard-headed and hyper-aggressive beast of the snow-ridden Mountains of Mourn. They are notoriously short-sighted and rely on their sense of smell to catch wind of predators. They are likely to lower their heads and charge anything they catch a whiff of that doesn’t smell like a Rhinox (which are distinctively foul smelling).\\n\\nAs the weather atop that icy realm is as likely to be blizzard-like as anything else, such shortsightedness isn’t too much of a drawback. Also, their double-horned and stone-hard heads can cause considerable damage. Even a Frost Dragon would move hastily to get out of the way of a stampeding herd of the great shaggy beasts.\\n\\nAs legends go, the first one to think of hooking heavy loads onto a Rhinox was the infamous Gnoblar called Ma, also known as Ma the Grub. The shifty and energetic Ma was the self-appointed King of the Gnoblar Scrappers and he left behind him many tales and no few inventions, some of which, like the Rhinox pulled Scraplauncher, are still remembered today, thanks to Ma’s prolific use of symbolic cave painting. Most cave paintings are lost or covered up over the years, but Ma’s were so filled with obviously obscene gestures and rude suggestions that none would dare to cover them up.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_origins_beastmen_description	The Beastmen carve out their lairs in the twisted forests of the Old World, but they are not creatures of nature. In fact, they have very little in common with anything wholesome or natural. They are a twisted product of Chaos; vile, aberrant parodies of Man and beast alike, but far more vigorous and powerful than either. The Cloven Ones, as they call themselves, belong to Chaos as fully and completely as a shark belongs to water, for they were born from the great catastrophe that irrevocably tainted the world with darkness.\\n\\nThe Beastmen came into being many thousands of years ago, when Chaos was first unleashed into the world and all that was normal and whole was washed away in a wave of tortured unreason. Legend tells of an elder race of beings, known only as the Old Ones, who shaped the world in a way pleasing to them and brought the first of the young races to pre-eminence.\\n\\nThen came the event that changed history in a single, terrible day. The dimensional gates at the poles of the Warhammer world, intended to facilitate astral travel, collapsed in on themselves. History does not record why, but what is known is that this allowed the stuff of Chaos to flow across the veils of space and time into the world at large.\\n\\nIt was a catastrophe beyond measure. Millions of innocent souls were lost in an instant, sucked into the void and replaced with entitles far fouler. The surface of the world writhed and bled like a wounded beast. From the skies came pulsing comets of wyrdling stone, contrails of unlight flaring in their wake as they plummeted toward the untamed forests.\\n\\nThe lands were pounded and punished as if by the fists of the gods themselves. Huge chunks of solidified Chaos energy, thrown from the collapsing dimensional gates, set aflame the skies. They crashed into the world like meteors, felling endless tracts of forest and burying themselves inside massive craters of scorched earth.\\n\\nWith each impact, the land was infected further by the raw stuff of Chaos. Its insidious taint worked outward into the fertile soil, suckled upon by the roots of ancient trees and seeping into the air breathed by the nomads and the beasts that populated the lands. As Chaos permeated all, the forests stirred, writhing with malign energies.\\n\\nWeird calls echoed from the trees as the woods thrashed with rampant growth. Strange and terrible processes were enacted in that dank, boiling cauldron of fecundity. The primitives of the region and the beasts of the forest were somehow mated, their terrible offspring born and mated again, generation after generation coming into being, indiscriminately reproducing and eventually dying in an uncontrolled and rapid procession. Thus was the race of the Beastmen born into the world.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_long_war_description	For thousands of years, the Beastmen and their night-bred kin ruled the forests. preying upon the scattered hands of men as wolves upon sheep. Then a man came bearing a golden hammer that was the bane of all enemies and united the human tribes, challenging the Beastmen for dominance of the lands. This warrior elevated Mankind from a collection of loosely organised tribesmen into the massive empire it is today.\\n\\nThe time before this man is regarded by the Beastmen both as a part-remembered dream and as a legend. The Beastmen’s rituals are full of references to a time when they ruled the lands unchallenged, and a time when they shall rule again.\\n\\nTo the Cloven Ones, the War of the Hammer heralded an age of bitterness and strife in which Mankind rose to undeserved and stolen power. The Beastmen of today hate Mankind with a deep loathing born of uncounted centuries of battle. They seek a return to that primeval age when Man was little more than a food-creature, and the Beastmen the true masters of the world.\\n\\nFor Mankind’s part, the Beastmen soon became creatures of horror and superstition, embodying and confirming their deepest fears of what might lurk in the forests of the Old World. It is said in the legends of Bretonnia that the Beastmen looked out from under the forest eaves, spying upon Man and in so doing knew their own impurity, while some scholars of the Empire hold that the beasts are jealous and resentful of Man’s ingenuity and cleanness of limb.\\n\\nWhatever the case, all men know that the Beastmen harbour a bitter hatred for humanity. This enmity goes far beyond jealousy or spite. It is not just Man that the Beastmen despise so, but his civilisation, his works and his gods.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_the_unmakers_description	As the society of Man has grown more refined, and his advancements increasingly wondrous, so the Beastmen have come to loathe him all the more. To the citizens of the Empire, Bretonnia and the other nations of the Old World, the Beastmen have come to represent creatures from a half-remembered age of nightmare.\\n\\nMen deceive themselves that the danger has passed; that they are safe in their walled towns, that their steel and gunpowder, wizards arts and engineers’ creations will hold at bay the lowly beast-things that haunt the woodlands. Men tell themselves that the creatures of the forest are disorganised and incapable of fielding armies that can threaten their crenelated, high-walled cities. They are quite wrong.\\n\\nTo underestimate the Beastmen is a fatal mistake. The Cloven Ones are creatures of violence and conflict, and they are far more cunning than the Empire believes. Worse still, the more noble and haughty the foe. the more the Beastmen are driven to prove their own supremacy by casting him down from his lofty pedestal and trampling his body beneath blood-encrusted, filthy hooves.\\n\\nThough the Beastmen have no formal method of recording the passage of years, they know that the cities of Mankind are new and recent compared to the elder lands in which the Beastmen roam. Even the lowliest Ungor knows that Mankind once cowered in terror of the forest and the creatures that dwelled within it, daring not to venture into the eaves of the woods.\\n\\nYet stone fortresses and castles now blight the lands from end to end in defiance of the dominion of Chaos. So advanced is the industry of man and the organisation of his empire that keeps and watchtowers are built even in the midst of the Beastmen’s territory.\\n\\nAnd yet the Beastmen know that such structures are temporary at best, and all that Man has built will one day come crashing down at the Beastmen’s hands. Only then will the lands once more belong to the Cloven Ones, and only then will Mankind be returned to his proper place in the order of things – prey, and nothing more.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_nature_beast_subtitle	The Nature of the Beast	false
gen_lore_bst_nature_beast_description	Beastmen are wild and crude creatures of animal lusts and vitriolic temperament. They are truly repugnant to behold, let alone to smell, for they are a twisted reflection of the base and barbaric aspects of nature.\\n\\nCreatures of violence and destruction, they are as unreasoning and deadly as the hurricane that tears apart the village, the plague that ravages the lands or the blight that kills the harvest. And yet the Beastmen are far worse, for they have little to do with the natural order of things.\\n\\nThe carnage and despair they spread across the land is not part of the eternal cycle of life and death but a malevolent and deliberate attempt to tear down and despoil everything of beauty, peace or sanctity, replacing it with filth and ruin. Even when gathered in their torrid encampments the Beastmen can be seen brawling, shouting, rutting, drinking or filling their hairy bellies with raw flesh, for they are vital and virile creatures that are never truly still.\\n\\nWhile other followers of Chaos may he gifted with all manner of manifestations of their patrons’ favour upon their path to damnation, the Beastmen crawl from the unclean wombs of the woods with a form perfectly suited to their horrid nature.\\n\\nThey have long, ridged horns with which to gore their foes, and the legs of cattle and goats with which to trample the bodies of their victims. Their matted hair is encrusted with blood and dung, a haven for fat ticks and colonies of fleas that keep the Beastmen in a constant state of agitation. Their drool-filled mouths are filled with sharp, wolf-like fangs for tearing the flesh of their prey, and their muscular, sweat-slicked bodies are ideally suited to the murderous desires that gleam in their blood-red eyes.\\n\\nAll Beastmen are surly and mean, for they know they are destined to live a short, brutal life of squalor and pain. When their blood is up and foul-smelling breath snorts from their gore-stained snouts, the Beastmen become belligerent and bellicose in the extreme, every gesture or glance brimming with hostility. The atavistic fury that each Beastman harbours within his soul is always but a moment away from the surface, and it is this rage that gives the Beastmen much of their unholy strength on the field of battle.\\n\\nBitterness and spite simmers in the heart of every Beastman; it takes little more than a few well-chosen words to spur a Gor into a frenzy of unrestrained rage. The sounds of distant battle will cause a Beastman to prick up his tufted ears in an instant; a fight or duel upon a woodland path will invariably bring dozens of Beastmen from all about in a very short space of time.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_fury_beast_description	Above all, it is the trappings of progress and civilisation that fan the embers of hatred burning within each Beastmen’s breast. A mere glimpse of bright colours, especially the colour red, will often be enough to get a Beastmen’s pulse racing with bloodlust.\\n\\nThe sight of a proud flag or coat of arms, a pristine uniform or a magnificent statue elicits a powerful reaction in the Beastmen, for the things of order are anathema to the Children of Chaos. All caution is put aside in a desperate attempt to tear down and befoul the offending article, to stomp it into the mud, smear it with dung or rip it to pieces and chew on the remains.\\n\\nWoe betide those who take pride in such symbols of authority and order, for their end will invariably be messy, painful and humiliating. Though Beastmen find it far easier to destroy than to create, they can be terribly inventive in the punishments they inflict upon their captives, and they have a sick and ribald sense of humour that leads to truly stomach-churning atrocities enacted upon those they can catch.\\n\\nNo Beastman is truly content unless visiting some manner of violence upon a hapless victim. The only tools they use are the tools of war, and even then they aren’t too fussy. They arm themselves with crude blades and axes that they call “man-cleavers”, mostly cobbled together from the spoils of war, for not even the nimble-fingered Ungor can truly master the skills of the smith.\\n\\nThe warherds lack the resplendent weapons and baroque armour of the human servants of the Chaos Gods, for the Beastmen already belong to the Ruinous Powers and the gods have no need to bargain such trinkets in exchange for their souls. This only serves to increase the jealous ire that the Beastmen have for their human contemporaries.\\n\\nNonetheless, the Beastmen excel at raiding, pillaging and corpse-robbing even when they are not marching to war. Because of this, they are never short of battered weapons and ragged suits of armour, albeit ones encrusted with clotted gore and riddled with rust. Such lack of quality is only a minor setback to the Beastmen, who compensate with sheer brute strength and determination.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_thrill_hunt_subtitle	The Thrill of the Hunt	false
gen_lore_bst_thrill_hunt_description	Much like packs of wolves or lions, Beastmen are accomplished hunters, but this has far more to do with the warherd’s innate ability to surround and entrap their prey than stealth or caution. In fact, all Beastmen are loud and impatient, and worse still they stink to high heaven; a rank combination of rotting blood, days-old vomit, stale sweat, dung and woodsmoke.\\n\\nHygiene is a foreign concept to the Beastmen. They scent-mark and defecate upon every landmark they pass without hesitation, and after a victory celebration they will collapse in a drunken stupor in low burrows, crude ditches and even steaming piles of night-soil, for they know not shame or disgust.\\n\\nThe robust constitution of the Cloven Ones allows them to live upon the most meagre or unpleasant of diets. They prefer great chunks of meat above all, but, unlike their larger Minotaur brethren, they do not care if it is fresh or if it is infested and maggot-ridden.\\n\\nBeastmen are cannibals who gorge themselves upon the corpses of their own kind without hesitation, entrails, hair, horns, hooves and all, and believe that to do so is to inherit the strength of the victim. This diet of dead meat is supplemented with grubs, hairy-legged spiders, poisonous centipedes, plump blowflies, and other vermin, as well as the occasional lost child or lone woodsman.\\n\\nIt could be said that Beastmen are hunter-gatherers, though they mainly gather the body parts strewn around the place after a particularly vicious hunt. Human flesh is a delicacy to Beastmen, and rivals have been known to fight to the death over a single human arm or leg.\\n\\nOf all the creatures of Chaos, Beastmen have an especially close relationship with Morrslieb, the Chaos Moon. Whenever Morrslieb is fullest in the sky the Beastmen will hold night-long, sprawling orgies where they indulge every base lust and bloodthirsty deed they can think of.\\n\\nMuch blood is shed, much captured wine and beer is drunk and many new beast-spawn are conceived, ensuring the cycle of twisted and unholy life is perpetuated. Though it is rumoured that the witches and heretics of the Old World join the Beastmen in these frightening and confusing bacchanales, none have ever been able to say for certain, for to stumble upon a camp of blood-drunk Beastmen celebrating under the unclean light of Morrslieb is to plunge into hell itself.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_rewards_ruin_description	Those Beastmen who do great and terrible deeds in the name of their bloodthirsty deities sometimes earn physical rewards for their service. Such gifts commonly exaggerate the bestial form of the recipient, making him all the more deadly a predator and proving his right to lead beyond doubt.\\n\\nSpectacular twisting horns grow from the warrior’s brow, hands sprout long razored talons that bleed poison, teeth enlarge into vicious swords of bone, skin secretes acidic mucous and hair clogs into an impenetrable hide. Still stranger transmutations include bodies of living flame, fang-studded appendages that grow from the recipient’s gut, coal-black skin that draws in the dark shadows, limbs that end in the gnashing heads of the bearer’s victims, bodies that swell into monstrously obese shapes, and a thousand other sickening forms besides.\\n\\nIn most cases, it is the chieftain of each tribe who is blessed with such rewards, for it is through his will and his hatred that the warherd acts, though it is not unheard of for a Bray-Shaman to bear the favour to the Chaos Gods, should he bring about the downfall of a powerful foe.\\n	false
gen_lore_bst_unnatural_order_title	The Cloven Ones	false
gen_lore_bst_unnatural_order_subtitle	The Unnatural Order	false
gen_lore_bst_unnatural_order_description	The Beastmen live in savage bands called warherds, consisting of anything from several dozen to many thousands of murderous individuals. Though they may walk upright and speak, the Beastmen are as close to animals as they are to men, and so the strongest prevail while the weak perish.\\n\\nViolence simmers beneath the surface of every exchange, each Beastman seeking every opportunity to enforce his superiority. Should any show weakness he will suffer for it, and his position within the warherd will be diminished. Hence each warherd is led by the strongest amongst them, a Beastmen marked by the favour of the Chaos Gods.\\n\\nThe warherd’s chieftain occupies the apex of tribal authority. It is his absolute right to rule as he pleases, provided that he has the strength to back it up. The chieftain is the master of his pack, but his supremacy is anything but uncontested. To maintain his position he has to continually fight off challenges from power-hungry Gors and Bestigors.\\n\\nHe makes a totem from the pelts of those he has defeated to prove his right to rule, so that his standard becomes a gory record of his conquests. One day, though, a challenger will come who is stronger and more vital than the current incumbent, and then the chieftain’s own hide will hang bleeding in the wind from the challenger’s totem.\\n\\nThe vast bulk of the warherd consists of Gors. These Beastmen form the main strength of the tribe when it is gathered under the chieftain’s harsh authority on the field of battle. At the bottom of the tribal order are the Ungors. These creatures are not considered proper Beastmen by the rest of the warherd, for their horns are nowhere near as impressive as those of the Gors.\\n\\nThe Ungors wait for battle for a chance to defy their station in life. Of all the Beastmen, a Man taken captive by a warherd should fear the Ungors the most, for while a Gor might grant him a swift and bloody end, the Ungors will torture him for as long as his body clings to life.\\n\\nAlongside the Gors live the Minotaur tribes. These are the mightiest of all Beastmen – hulking, bull-headed monsters whose all-consuming bloodgreed drives them to terrifying acts of slaughter.\\n\\nIt is only the sheer, animal domination of the chieftain that binds the unruly masses of the Beastmen into an army instead of a raiding force. Yet even upon the field of battle his position can be challenged, sometimes turning a defeat into a victory by the timely replacement of a weak leader with one determined to prove his newly won dominance.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_blasphemy_blood_gorge_subtitle	The Blasphemy of Blood-Gorge	false
gen_lore_bst_blasphemy_blood_gorge_description	The Beastmen instinctively know that blasphemy is the dark reflection of reverence, and that to defile the image or shrine of a god is to rob that entity of power. It is the wish of the Ruinous Powers, and therefore the innate desire of the Beastmen themselves, to diminish and ultimately destroy the weakling gods of man. These feeble deities do not deserve their place in the heavens next to the old and primal gods of Chaos.\\n\\nUpon a windswept heath before the mighty Forest of Arden is to be found a blasphemy most pleasing to the Chaos Gods. For many years, the warherds dwelling in the forest had suffered the presence of a powerful and devout sorceress, a Damsel residing in a fortified retreat near the forest’s edge.\\n\\nMany warherds had assailed her sanctuary, only to be repulsed by the magics of the Damsel and the spears of her loyal retainers, or else driven off as valiant knights rode to the she-witch’s rescue. And so it was that a Beastlord named Kloven Blood-Gorge gathered a great brayherd and embarked upon the campaign that would earn him the bitter enmity of every knight in Bretonnia.\\n\\nKloven’s shamans summoned flocks of Harpies, foul-winged creatures of the air. Bound to Kloven’s will, the Harpies swept through the night, swooping down upon the sentries manning the high walls of the sanctuary.\\n\\nAs the sentries were dragged screaming from the walls, the sanctuary’s defenders mustered to repel the attackers, rushing up stone steps to face this terrible new foe. At that moment, the night was rent by the deafening bellow of a gargantuan Ghorgon at full charge, followed a moment later by the ear-splitting report of the sanctuary’s gates splintering apart. Within minutes, Kloven’s Gors were flooding the sanctuary. Soon every building within was aflame.\\n\\nThe defenders put up a spirited defence, but had been caught unawares. The spells of the sorceress slew dozens of Beastmen, but it was not enough, and the defenders were overwhelmed. The survivors were bound and carried back to the forest. A tall, stone statue of the she-witch’s goddess stood at the altar of the now-burning chapel. This the Harpies carried off, a hundred of their number straining to lift it into the night air and bear it towards the forest.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_klovens_ambush_description	It was several days before the Men came, as Kloven had known they would. Countless knights crested the rise and came to a halt half a league from the forest. What had caused them to halt was the statue itself smeared in filth, its serene countenance disfigured beneath a horned crown of twisted branches and the bones of the captives.\\n\\nSeeing this blasphemy, a great cry went up from the knights. Ranks became disordered as Men bellowed their outrage at one another and their unseen foe. Just then Kloven Blood-Gorge stepped out from the forest’s edge, and with him countless numbers of his followers.\\n\\nBehind Kloven stood a hundred elite Bestigors, snorting and stamping in their barely restrained eagerness to set about the killing. Stretching out to either side were the massed Gors, their crude braying and the droning of their war horns drowning out all other sound.\\n\\nAmongst the horde there strode frenzied, four-armed Ghorgons, each restrained from charging headlong only by the will of Kloven Blood-Gorge.\\n\\nSeeing their quarry, the knights roared and spurred their mounts forward as one. Kloven bellowed in answer and the horde surged forward in a great mass. Fired as each Man was by rage and bitterness, the knights fought not as an army, but as individuals, each vowing to be the one to claim vengeance.\\n\\nThe warherd of Kloven Blood-Gorge fought with the single-minded determination instilled in them by the power of their leader. Though the knights ran down scores of Beastmen as their charge hit home, the Beastmen eventually dragged their foes to the ground, unhorsing them and hacking them to ragged chunks in the mud.\\n\\nThe battle raged from midday until the setting of the sun, and by day’s end the Bestigors held aloft a dozen of the Men’s banners, no longer bright and proud but befouled and tattered. As the last of the knights’ underlings fled the field, Kloven regarded a scene of unsurpassed slaughter and knew he had done well.\\n\\nThe defiled statue has stood ever since, a dread mockery of all that the Bretonnians hold dear. Many have come to cast it down, and all have died at the hands of the Beastmen. Of the sorceress, nothing was ever heard again, though one thing is for sure — her own tale did not have a pleasant ending.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_endless_hunt_description	The Beastmen build no cities, for order and construction are anathema to them. They roam far and wide, following the scent of fresh meat and fearful prey. The Old World is their territory and their hunting ground, lands they regard and refer to as their blood-grounds. It has always been so, since the coming of Chaos in a distant and legendary age.\\n\\nThe Beastmen are tough and strong, for they must compete with the unimaginable horrors that haunt the woods. Beneath the dark forest canopy, the Beastmen are often the prey of yet more disturbing creatures.\\n\\nThough the Beastmen dwell within the forests, they rarely stay in one location for long. Instead, they move from place to place along ancient paths within the territory of each warherd, occasionally encroaching upon the domains of other tribes. Though no sane man can make sense of it, there is sometimes a pattern to these movements – sudden changes in direction, or an uncanny coordination between disparate warbands, that hint at a far grander plan.\\n\\nWhen a halt is called, the Beastmen establish temporary sites from which to launch their merciless invasions of the surrounding areas, and where they will hold their bloodthirsty celebrations afterwards. They usually stay in the one place only for a short time before moving on to find another suitable site in their hunting grounds. Beastmen warbands will often roam for hundreds of miles before setting up camp again, frequently battling other Beastmen for the choicest spots.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_calling_brayherd_subtitle	Calling the Brayherd	false
gen_lore_bst_calling_brayherd_description	The brayherd is a mustering of all of the warherds in a given region. Each brayherd is called by a chieftain who, with his blood up and his ire roused, determines that the herds must be gathered and war must be brought to the lands of Man. The chieftain, being a surly, rancorous creature, will have plotted a mighty vengeance to visit upon his foe, and calculated according to his instinctive, animalistic nature how best to achieve his deadly goals.\\n\\nA chieftain does not foster his dreams of conquest and cruelty alone, for he will be counselled all the while by his Bray-Shaman. The Bray-Shaman will consult the portents and divine the will of the Chaos Gods, until he believes the time is right to call the brayherd. It is upon the word of the chieftain that the brayherd is called, but none would do so were it not for the affirmation of a Bray-Shaman’s counsel, for Beastmen are creatures of superstition who only truly fear the wrath of the gods.\\n\\nThe calling of the brayherd starts with the building of a massive pyre, often made of the dried bones of sacrificial offerings or from timber torn from the shrines of Man’s gods. Onto the fire the Bray-Shaman casts a noxious preparation of leaves, lichens and weeds imbued with the ancient magic of the deep woods.\\n\\nCoiling mists aglow with evil creep out from the fire to twist and turn along the forest paths. The vapours inflame the rotten hearts of the Beastmen with bloodlust and draw them to the site of the brayherd. To this magical summons is added the strident bellowing of the chieftain that would call the brayherd, his hoarse cries resounding through the night.\\n\\nAs the numbers of Beastmen at the site increase, so the forests echo with their unruly braying and the chanting of the shamans. One after another each chieftain steps into the clearing, making his presence known. If the calling is taking place at a herdstone or similar structure, the chieftain will carve his mark into its surface, so that his coming might be known to all for years to come.\\n	false

Led by chanting, shrieking Bray-Shamans, the Beastmen perform the ugliest, basest acts imaginable.\\n\\nCaptives are dragged forth and sacrificed before the herdstones, their wailing, the taste of their fear and the scent of their butchered flesh attracting Minotaurs who wolf down their remains in bloody gulps. The forests resound to the screams of enemy soldiers bound to the herdstones by their own viscera, such that Men for leagues in every direction tremble and pray to their gods that it is not their town the savage hordes will descend upon when dawn finally arrives.\\n\\nAs daylight nears, the rituals climax. From the shrouded treeline the atonal droning of warhorns sound, accompanied by the dolorous, arhythmic pounding of mighty drums made from the flayed skins of defeated foes. Soon, massed figures emerge from the mists and the horde becomes visible in all its terrible glory.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_horde_rises_description	The tactics employed by the Beastmen are not the practiced drills of many other races, but the inherent guile of a pack of wild animals stalking and encircling its prey. They sense weakness and smell fear, surging forward for the kill and falling upon their prey in an orgy of butchery.\\n\\nThe coming of the horde is always presaged by a cacophonous braying. As if to amplify their already deafening war cries, the Beastmen employ war horns fashioned from the tusks of forest creatures or the horns of slain rivals.\\n\\nThey carry a bewildering array of banners adorned with the heads of fallen enemies and daubed with the crude runes that identify each herd. Such banners are used to increase the Beastmen’s own stature, ensuring that even distant enemies can see the dominance and strength of the bearers.\\n\\nAt the centre of the horde as it surges forward are heavily armoured, elite Bestigors. Equipped with huge axes taken from the treasures stacked at the base of each herdstone, these Beastmen hack into the enemy as farmers scythe down wheat. The Bestigors will fight to the death to take the banners of their foe, trampling enemy standards into the mud as the bulk of the horde comes on in their bloody wake.\\n\\nAll the while, Gors and Ungors stalk through the undergrowth to encircle and hem in the enemy battleline, moving into the most advantageous positions before springing horribly effective ambushes upon the flanks and rear of the enemy army. Many a gunnery or archer battalion has believed itself safe behind sharpened stakes and defensible positions only to find that the Beastmen had them surrounded from the start.\\n\\nAlongside the warherd comes the Minotaurs, driven to such extremes of violence by the scent of blood, they cannot wait until the day is won to feast upon their victims – they gorge themselves on the flesh of their dying foes even as battle rages all around. The beasts of the wild come too.\\n\\nAbove the battlefield ragged flocks of Harpies screech and squabble over the remains of the dead. Twisted Chaos Spawn thrash and writhe as the raw power of Chaos surges through their veins. Even larger creatures accompany the horde; terrifying Cygors, rot-clad Giants of the forests, and bloated, betentacled things that lurk within the forest bogs and can swallow whole a dozen men in a single gulp.\\n\\nWhen the herds form up for battle, it is not as small, ragged bands but as fully armed and battle-ready armies united by the will of the chieftain. The sight is sufficient to strike terror into even the bravest warriors, for such a menagerie of horrors can consume all before it.\\n	false
gen_lore_bst_beast_tongue_title	The Cloven Ones	false
gen_lore_bst_beast_tongue_subtitle	The Beast Tongue	false
gen_lore_bst_beast_tongue_description	The Dark Tongue is a ritual language and the only tongue in which the true mysteries of Chaos can properly be expressed. The language is rich in words and phrases that express the mystical and arcane complexity of Chaos. It is the language used by daemons when they enter the material world, as well as the basis of the languages spoken by the many mortal followers of Chaos, including the Beastmen.\\n\\nThe core of the Dark Tongue is a collection of root words, heavily endowed with meaning. The root word is altered by the addition of prefixes and suffixes to bring out the various potential meanings held within the root. Yet more meanings are yielded from the root by mutation of the root itself.\\n\\nIt can be a highly complex language, but equally it can be spoken in a very simple manner. Although it is convenient for mortals to attach basic meanings to each word, in reality they are imbued with far greater and deeper significance to the daemons themselves; each word encompasses a myriad of associated meanings and concepts, as well as holding a power in themselves.\\n\\nBeastmen can only form many of the sounds of the Dark Tongue with difficulty, and other sounds are impossible for them to pronounce with their fang-filled, bestial mouths. They use a crude mix of brutish sounds together with the Dark Tongue and the regional languages of the Old World to form a language commonly called the Beast Tongue.\\n\\nTo an outsider, this bastardised language sounds little more than a braying jumble of noise, a cacophony of growls, bleats and guttural howls. Indeed, their language is not at all subtle, and some of them do not have the power of speech at all. However, they are intelligent creatures, and even the most base of them can understand speech, though they themselves might only be able to communicate using grunts and growls.\\n\\nThe Beast Tongue is an unnatural sounding language that Men cannot speak – when Beastmen and the Human followers of Chaos meet, they communicate using a mix of basic Dark Tongue, Beast Tongue, body language and signals to convey their meanings.\\n\\nWhen leaving their mark on the herdstones, the Beastmen use a corrupted and simplified version of the phonetic runes that are sometimes used to write the Dark Tongue. However, the marks carved by Beastmen are crude affairs, for they write only with difficulty and, as such, their written language is particularly direct and to the point.\\n	false

gen_lore_bst_chaos_magic_description	In the time before the coming of the Elves and Dwarfs, the Old Ones ruled the globe. Their powers of magic verged on the godlike, and with it they shaped the continents and raised up the different races. But when catastrophe struck and the Gate to Heaven collapsed, the source of their power was rent open and raw Chaos spilled into the world.\\n\\nAll magic users must tap into this source of magical energy for their power, but the Bray-Shamans of the Beastmen use this energy in the most ‘natural’ way. These Beastmen are born into the world instinctively knowing how to manipulate Chaos energy in its raw form, and so when they cast their spells, they do so in the same way that other beasts instinctively know how to hunt or howl at the moon.\\n\\nIt is a natural trait that they have, and they do not learn the art of spellcasting through study like other sorcerers or wizards. Chaos magic is highly destructive, drawing upon the winds of Death and Shadows more than any other. Those truly gifted in the magical arts, those whose patron powers have bestowed gifts of knowledge and strength upon them, can further mould the Winds of Magic in more elaborate fashions.\\n\\nThe Bray-Shamans of Nurgle use magic to pervert and corrupt all things natural around them, inflicting hideous diseases that cannot be cured. They can twist the bodies of their opponents and cause delirium in their foes, as well as blighting the crops of men and causing their livestock to perish.\\n\\nMore subtle are the practitioners of the Lore of Slaanesh. Suggestion, mind-altering illusions and spells of domination are their weapons, and these Bray-Shamans can blind others to the presence of Beastmen living in their midst.\\n\\nMost powerful and feared of all are the dread Beast Champions of Tzeentch. These warrior-wizards are true Champions of Chaos, for they can fight with the strength of a madman, yet all the knowledge of the world is theirs to be had, giving them sorcerous powers unequalled by even the most accomplished sorcerers of other gods. Tzeentch Champions can channel the raw colours of magic, unleashing mutating flames and ripping apart the enemy with blazes of iridescent power.\\n	false

Each of these kaleidoscopic spires is home to one of the nine legions, known as the Scintillating Hosts, that Tzeentch favours at any given time, and each is ruled by its most powerful daemon.\\n\\nThere, the titular Overseer receives commands from Tzeentch himself and, in turn, relays their own version of those orders outwards to the subordinate convocations, who compete to earn their god’s approval and occupy one of the fortresses. The number of convocations is in constant flux, though it is never fewer than nine and is always a multiple of that sacred number.\\n\\nWithin the Realm of Chaos, Tzeentch’s daemons battle those of the other Dark Gods, staving off invasions or seeking to claim territory. Alliances are forged, broken and forged again, yet none can weave in or out of such treaties with as much skill as the minions of the Great Schemer.\\n\\nTzeentch covets mortal souls, and his forces actively pursue hundreds of different plots, such as shifting the strands of fate or covertly persuading mortal recruits to serve in his cults. Like their patron, the convocations seek sources of magic, spread anarchy and corrupt ambitions. When illusion or manipulation fail, however, they resort to more direct methods, setting battlefields alight with volleys of spells and sheets of warpfire.	false

gen_lore_tze_eternal_rivalry_description	Far beyond the light of sun or star, removed from all reason and reality, lies the Realm of Chaos. Here, the Chaos Gods strive against one another in a never-ending power struggle. As one god grows in strength, so do the others conspire against him.\\n\\nCommon cause will unite the disparate powers, but even then each god angles to ensure that they emerge from the alliance in a better position than the others. In this endless scheming, none of the gods fare so well as Tzeentch, and he delights in manipulating them all – tormenting ever-raging Khorne or endlessly baiting proud, melodramatic Slaanesh.\\n\\nHowever, every Chaos God has his opposite, another whose nature is the antithesis of his own. For Tzeentch, that special foe is Nurgle. The Lord of Decay provides Tzeentch with his fiercest rivalry. Nurgle counters Tzeentch’s hope and ambition, his demand for change, with opposing ideologies: a resigned despair that accepts how things are, a willingness not just to be content with the base or mundane but to actually wallow in it.\\n\\nIn their unending battles, Tzeentch pits his ceaseless evolution against the stagnant loop of Nurgle’s closed cycle of life and death. Tzeentch, who delights in his carefully laid plans, is appalled to watch Nurgle’s slovenly and indiscriminate acts, his jovial attitude to sowing seeds of destruction and letting them grow where they may. The two powers never miss an opportunity to match forces against one another, be it battles over boundaries in the Realm of Chaos, expansionist wars in the Chaos Wastes or even scholastic rivalries and cultish intrigues in the many nations of the mortal realm.\\n\\nOf late, Tzeentch has gained the upper hand. In the Blighted Grove, where once Nurgle reigned nearly unchallenged, his decaying legions were lost forever in an unrealised future as a result of the machinations of Kairos Fateweaver. On the outskirts of the Shard Lands, Tzeentch has all but eradicated the stain of Nurgle’s infections, using a sustained crusade of metallic transmutation that sterilised everything the Grandfather of Plagues had corrupted by disease.\\n\\nThe victories of Tzeentch over Nurgle are by no means confined to the material world. In the power struggles fought in the Realm of Chaos, his daemonic minions are usually key to his victories over his brother gods – few mortal agents could stand the sheer inimical otherness of that sinister dimension for long.\\n\\nFrom beside Nurgle’s Great Cauldron itself, the Changeling aided the Blue Scribes in stealing a seven-volume set of tomes listing cures for the Plague God’s most potent diseases, and on the borders of Nurgle’s Garden, the Swamp of Ages was crystallised during the War of Slime and Fire.\\n\\nYet just as moons wax and wane, so too does the power balance between the rival gods of  Chaos. It does not all go Tzeentch’s way – his minions dare not mention the disaster at the Crystal Spires or the Night of Cataracted Eyes, during which so many of his daemons were rendered blind by a supernatural plague that for a time Tzeentch himself contracted the same disease.\\n	false

gen_lore_tze_gateways_unreason_description	Tzeentch’s daemons often enter the lands of mortals through sites of summonation, having been called from beyond by those who would bind them. Such hermetic conjurations carry a huge degree of risk, however.\\n\\nThe daemons of Tzeentch are experts in the arcane arts; magic runs in their blood – or, rather, forms their very substance. They will spot a minute imperfection in a spell or a mangled syllable in the Dark Tongue of a Chaos ritual as eagerly as a miser spots a gold coin in a shallow puddle.\\n\\nShould a would-be daemonologist make such a critical error in his summonations, he may soon find the creature he sought to bind emerging from its ritual circle with a leer of dark glee. The lucky ones are slain soon afterwards, burned to death by warpfire or ripped to pieces by sharp claws. Those less fortunate find themselves the servants rather than the masters, their souls bound forever to the whims of the same arcane forces they hoped to use to their own advantage.\\n\\nSome of those who sought glory and power from the Architect of Fate are irrevocably changed, bearing iridescent scales, feathered crests or clawed appendages in place of limbs. For the most part, those souls that Tzeentch has claimed for his own bear no mark at all, or else they use glamours and spells to keep the vile aberrations of their form hidden from all save their fellow spellcasters.\\n\\nThey labour in secret within the courts, colleges and laboratories of the world, making the most of their daemonic patronage to ascend through society. They then teach new generations the arts of their craft as if there were nothing untoward about their pre-eminence – but with ever darker inflections laced through every spell and secret they impart.\\n	false

The land cracks to form needle-fanged mouths that scream in protest, for such intense concentrations of magic are rarely seen outside the warped wastelands of the Chaos Wastes. The servants of Tzeentch have shucked off their illusions and gone to war en masse, and with them comes the terrible truth: the mortal world is but a stage for the Master of Fates to conduct his grand orchestra.\\n\\nThe servants of Tzeentch are neither simple warriors nor brawlers, nor are they mercenaries or soldiers of fortune; they train but rarely with the sword and the bow, and they spurn the cannon and the gun. Nor do they study the treatises of warmasters and conquerors from ages past.\\n\\nTo them, such conventional conceits, such everyday tools of battle, are as crass and simplistic as the daubings of a child upon a father’s masterpiece. To these devotees of change, the notion of war is mutable in the extreme, as is the flesh and mindscape of the foe. They fight their battles on several planes at once – the mental, the spiritual and the physical all mingling together into one mindboggling and spectacular whole.\\n\\nTzeentch’s devoted are steeped in matters arcane. Through long study and diabolical pact, their understanding of the nature of things is so advanced that they can shape reality. With an arrhythmical chant or a carefully inscribed phrase given voice, they conjure bolts of wyrdfire that can strip a man’s flesh from his bones or melt stone to the consistency of butter.\\n\\nSome can peer into the future or squint into the murky mists of the past, plucking secrets from the pliant branches of fate that they have bent to their will. To fight them is maddening, for to land a solid strike against such an enemy is nigh impossible.\\n	false

gen_lore_tze_children_change_subtitle	The Children of Change	false
gen_lore_tze_children_change_description	Tzeentchian daemons are physical manifestations of raw arcane energy, warped to reflect different aspects of their patron. As befits the Changer of the Ways, the nature of his minions varies greatly, although each is blessed with a portion of their master’s strangeness and cunning. So infused are they with magic that the air about them takes on an unearthly glimmer. Likewise, their own colours and even material stability shift – sometimes they appear corporeal, other times bafflingly illusive.\\n\\nAs daemons, the Scintillating Hosts have need for neither nourishment nor rest, and they cannot be slain as can mortal creatures. It is possible to destroy a daemon’s physical shell, but doing so only sends its spirit back to the Realm of Chaos, where it begins the painful process of reforming.\\n\\nThe length of time this takes depends upon the daemon’s size, strength and, most importantly, whether or not the being still carries their god’s favour. In the case of the Horrors – that most numerous of all Tzeentchian daemons – even a solid, killing blow is not nearly enough to end the threat.\\n\\nThese creatures split into two lesser creatures before the eyes of their astonished adversaries – and should either of these be slain in turn, they will split again to form hideous creatures of spite and flame. Such impossibilities, so maddening to mortal onlookers, give Tzeentch a great deal of amusement.\\n\\nIt is difficult in the extreme for any one daemon to hold Tzeentch’s attention for long; the god is not inclined to rouse from his introspections in order to concentrate on a single iteration of his immensity. So immersed is he in his weighty schemes that it has been many years since Tzeentch’s physical form left the Impossible Fortress at the heart of the Crystal Labyrinth.\\n\\nThere, in the sanctum of the Hidden Library, the Great Conspirator prefers instead to read the infinite skeins of fate and to send forth his daemonic legions to advance his ineffable plans. The fates of individuals, be they mortal or daemonic, yield but the briefest flicker of interest or amusement before Tzeentch’s attention moves elsewhere. Yet when taken together, the infinite complexities of every overlapping life, broken soul and unintended consequence forms a mosaic of disaster that the god finds eternally enthralling.	false

gen_lore_tze_kaleidoscopic_carnage_description	The onrush of the daemon legions of Tzeentch is a sight that can plunge the sane into raving madness. The very air shimmers with polychromatic colours as an outpouring of pure sorcery bursts above the oncoming masses.\\n\\nCapering Pink Horrors chortle as they advance, summoning mystic bolts from their strange, fluted fingers as easily as an archer would draw an arrow from his quiver. Sullen Blue Horrors grumble behind, wreathed in azure fires, while bright yellow Brimstone Horrors dance around their feet.\\n\\nLike strange living mushrooms borne on clouds of superheated air, Flamers bound by, mutagenic fire pouring from their twisted limbs as they roar and screech from their many mouths. The skies, meanwhile, are streaked black in the wake of Burning Chariots, each a fiery comet of destruction that sends warpflame cascading into the ranks of the enemy to twist flesh and metal into horrendous new shapes.\\n\\nWith them come airborne shoals of predatory Screamers that descend in stately, overlapping arcs to slash through the flesh of their prey with their bladed wings. Those who present a particularly delicious morsel of soul energy, perhaps because of their magical acumen or some supernatural strength from within, find themselves beset by dozens of these creatures at once, each frenzied with the need to clamp their toothy lamprey mouths upon the flesh of the gifted or the blessed.\\n\\nAfter Tzeentch issues commands to his armies, he contemplates their infinite effects. Gazing upon his creations with fascination, he is eager to watch his children plot, deceive and manipulate even their own forces in order to further their ambitions. Where things go awry, he drinks in the heady mix of improvisation and confusion – a rich loam from which moments of spontaneous genius can grow.\\n\\nWhen things go exactly according to plan, the Changer of the Ways taps his long talons together in a strange mixture of satisfaction and anxiety, for a predictable outcome courts boredom and there is nothing Tzeentch hates more. And so he avidly watches the unravelling of every strand of fate, each a small part of his Great Plan – though, in the end, all fates are woven into one, and the ultimate outcome is doom.\\n	false

gen_lore_tze_shape_invisible_description	The Changer of the Ways has little time for the cantrips and hedge magics of cowardly dabblers, instead rewarding those who gather vast concentrations of magical force and let them loose upon the world. With the Winds of Magic blowing strongly from the north, it is easier than ever for mages to summon magical familiars and seal dark pacts to increase their own power, or to conjure predatory spells and grand hexes that can cripple or destroy dozens of their adversaries in a matter of moments.\\n\\nSome of these spells gain notoriety or fame amongst cultists and will come easily to the Scintillating Hosts. These can see their mages attempt to prove their power over the ineffable by casting certain spells and invocations.\\n\\nSome wizards increase their arcane knowledge by conjuring a Tome of Eyes – a semi-real, outsized grimoire that appears on a pillar of magical flame. As the would-be scholar reads the forbidden spells from its burning pages, they are read in turn by the evil-looking orbs that stare out from it, their soul scrutinised and their secrets taken for later use.\\n\\nOthers summon a Burning Sigil of Tzeentch – after years of keeping their allegiance secret, they revel in displaying the icon of their true patron. The sheer mutative power of this change-sigil will see all those around it horrifically mutated and twisted by Chaos, though not always to their detriment.\\n\\nOnly the bravest mages dare to summon a Daemonic Simulacrum, the swirling magic they conjure taking form as the evil, avian heads of Lords of Change. These can tear the minds from the bodies of those nearby, leaving only drooling imbeciles. Woe betide the caster who stands too close, for the mind of a mage is the most delicious of all...\\n	false

Our enclave has been discovered. Even now the Moon Dragon’s Crowmen are coming.”\\n\\nThe iridescent plumage of the Lord of Change shimmered as its gaze shifted towards the sacrificial victims strewn about the chamber’s floor. “Tell me Fangyin, this binding ritual – have you done it correctly?”\\n\\nThe Magister was accustomed to daemons and their deflections, and refused to be sidetracked.\\n\\n“Bring forth your armies,” he begged. The sounds of battle could now be heard outside the hidden sanctuary. The Lord of Change laughed, at once like breaking glass and the distant call of crows.\\n\\n“Three times three the offerings be,” said the daemon as it strode beyond the circle of blood-scrawled glyphs.\\n\\n“One of the souls you offered was already mine, Fangyin.” Horrified, the Magister looked at the sacrifices to see only eight bodies and the fading illusion of the phantom ninth. “Nonetheless, I am still inclined to help your cult. However, a few of the plan’s details will have to change. I will require a few concessions...”\\n	false

He discerned the nine code words in the man’s idle chat, and quickly put down his quill and hurried through the archival stacks towards the rendezvous site.\\n\\nSomething was wrong. The hallways were more crowded than usual at this time, and from beneath his hood Tauschung peered out, anxious to mark any telltale signs that might alert him to the presence of any of his fellow cultists amongst the crowds.\\n\\nHe saw none. Commotion and raised voices came from the Great Hall ahead, and Tauschung arrived to witness a group of hulking Warrior Priests of Sigmar surrounding someone. He jostled through the gathering crowd until he could see that it was a scribe whom he had seen before but never spoken to. Tauschung was unsure whether he was even an Acolyte.\\n\\n“You bear the mark of the traitor,” boomed the leader of the armoured giants. “Justice will be done!” Even as one of the Warrior Priests grabbed the scribe by the arm, Tauschung felt the hairs on his neck rise. A sizzling bolt of pure iridescence seared overhead, striking the Warrior Priests’ leader and holding him, writhing, for a moment, before felling him. All eyes watched as his armour bulged, split, and tentacles wriggled out of the cracks.\\n\\n“The justice of tyrants is not justice,” shouted a voice from atop the stairwell. Nachtgier, the Magister, was revealed in his true form. “Brothers, sisters, it is time!” he called. At those words, the hall shimmered. Tauschung did as he was bid – discarding his illusions, he donned his ritual mask and drew his blade. A hot rush of adrenaline surged up his spine as he saw that the crowds around him had done the same. Grinning, he charged.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_they_who_seek_excess_description	Though mortal servants of Slaanesh may begin their journey to damnation as simple thrill-seekers and sensualists, they soon become enslaved to their proclivities and addictions. Everything wholesome and sound is left behind, morality and even sanity abandoned as a snake sloughs off its skin, until only a living incarnation of desire remains.\\n\\nThose who regularly indulge their secret vices unwittingly empower Slaanesh, and are but a hair’s breadth from his worship, whether intentional or not. Even a breathy word from a daemon of Slaanesh, crossing the aether much as a kiss blown from the lips, can push such an individual over the edge into a spiral of obsession.\\n\\nA small voice may cry out within the soul, warning that all is not well – that way lies madness. But it is drowned out by the relentless tide of temptation that emanates from Slaanesh to lap against every mortal with a personality given to the slightest indulgence.\\n\\nA savoured luxury or secret treat, formerly partaken of only as a reward or during a celebration, can all too easily develop into a semi-regular fixture of a person’s routine. As the mortal’s willpower gradually erodes, those moments of weakness become a daily occurrence, and – as the claws of excessiveness sharpen and sink in deep – the sole focus of the supplicant’s existence.\\n\\nPreoccupation leads to intemperance, then decadence, then debauchery. All proper duties and innocent pursuits are put aside, material possessions and even loved ones bartered away so that the next fix may come a few moments sooner.\\n\\nBy this time it is too late, for Slaanesh’s claim upon that soul is all but concrete. When all caution is thrown to the wind, and the corrupted individual reveals themselves as a seeker of extreme experience at the exclusion of all else, a dark metamorphosis can take place, both within and without.\\n\\nTheir unspoken pact with Slaanesh is all too often sealed with a blade, for should the obsessive feel driven to kill in order to protect or further their grotesque vice, they pass the point of no return. Those who commit murder in the name of their obsession complete their sinister transformation into a servant of the Dark Prince. Their destiny from then on is to cavort alongside fiends and monsters in the service of a gloating, uncaring god until they lie torn and forgotten by the wayside.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_wrought_mortal_flesh_description	Some followers of Slaanesh, in the act of making their desires central to their existence, are rewarded with mutations and strange powers by their divine patron. These tend to further the devotee’s ability to immerse themselves in that vice, encouraging them to wallow in their own madness in a self-perpetuating cycle until they embody their own corruption to a supernatural degree. Like the daemons of Slaanesh, they grow into forms perfectly suited to the acts of excess upon which they feed, just as the deep-leeches of the Vampire Coast have adapted to feed on the blood of those who stray into their swamps.\\n\\nSlaanesh’s supplicants have grotesque anatomies clad in sumptuous clothing and bedazzling jewels. They sport artful warpaint and cosmetic flourishes, applied to features so distorted and twisted that they strike a note of horror into the heart.\\n\\nThe mutants in their ranks often have wide, orb-like eyes, their giant pupils so dilated they appear as wells of darkest black that drink in every detail. Others are noseless, their olfactory organs gaping pits that channel every scent straight into the brain, or have long pointed ears so attuned to the hunt they twitch in time to the heartbeats of those they seek to slay.\\n\\nLong, fluid-slicked tongues push out from sensuous lips and elongated maws to taste the air, delighting in the banquet of the battlefield laced with raging pheromones, the harsh spike of gunpowder, and the acrid tang of blood and sweat. Those with enhanced kinaesthetic senses thrill to the full spectrum of touch, from the gentle brushing of skin while darting through the enemy battlelines, to the violent thrust of the blade that takes an enemy leader’s life in a blink.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_indulgence_given_form_description	The daemons of Slaanesh that fight alongside the Dark Prince’s mortal adherents are, in a sense, avatars of their god. All daemons are formed of the same spiritual essence as the deity they serve; one can get a glimpse of the beautiful yet repugnant nature of the Dark Prince by witnessing the creatures that serve him. They are all possessed of a burning need to bathe in every excessive act they can conceive of, and bring about that same need in their mortal prey.\\n\\nThe daemons of Slaanesh are usually lithe and pale of skin, favouring the most expensive gems, metals and silks with which to decorate their forms – even wearing tanned human skin as fine leather. A fixation upon material possessions is a vice like any other, and vanity – or, rather, outright narcissism – is among Slaanesh’s favourites.\\n\\nAmbitious and self-aggrandising, his daemons do everything they can to increase their standing in the courts of their godly master, whether through poisoned words, infighting, dark pacts or the pursuit of genuine excellence. The vector matters little, only the result – and their elevated place among their unhallowed kind.\\n\\nMultiple arms and appendages are common in the ranks of the Slaaneshi daemons, each ending in a razored claw or darting pincers that can snip straight through a victim’s limb in a burst of gory sensation. Long, sinuous tails wrap around their prey like serpents, constricting to squeeze the life from them with something that is half lover’s caress, half murderer’s stranglehold. To a large extent a Slaaneshi daemon’s anatomy is determined by their own vicious drives and unwholesome lusts, their forms a catalogue of fleshy horrors that are not hidden, but proudly adorned and put on display for all to see.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_the_sweet_release_description	The supplicants of Slaanesh savour the sensations of open war as a gourmet savours rich food and wines. Small wonder, when one considers the intensity of experience to be enjoyed in the thick of open conflict. On the field of battle can be found extreme terror, agonising pain, fiercely burning hope and bloodlust given free rein, and Slaanesh’s faithful delight in every nuance of hostility as they deliver one perfect kill after another.\\n\\nThey are gluttons seeking to ingest as much sensation as they can, not caring how their blows land, only that they do – and in great measure. They often fight with several weapons at once, tongues, tails and other extremities spiking out alongside scything talons and slashing blades. The highest in status sometimes ride blade-wheeled chariots designed to deliver the maximum amount of carnage as quickly as possible.\\n\\nTo a devotee of Slaanesh, their particular obsession seems to them the only correct path to the glory of the Dark Prince; those with other priorities are considered simpletons or barbarians unable to appreciate the gifts of their absent patron. To those who face a warrior of the Dark Prince on the battlefield, it makes little difference – they see only a cavalcade of madness racing towards them, howling and shrieking in hideous glee as they close in for the kill.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_the_final_temptation_description	One of the strangest and most unsettling aspects of a Daemonette is that – despite the corruption they wear so openly, and despite the aura of blackest indulgence they emanate – they are somehow alluring to the mortal eye. Slender, naked limbs entwine in languid gestures as these daemons frolic and slink, an unclean mirage of attraction making it hard to tear the eyes away.\\n\\nThose who prove weak-willed will find themselves stumbling half-dazed into the waiting arms of the Daemonettes, believing they will experience a pleasure like no other. They are soon disabused of the notion, for instead of finding sensual delights, they are slashed or torn apart by the leering monstrosity that held them spellbound a few moments before. To a Daemonette, the screams elicited by such a terrible revelation are the sweetest music.\\n\\nThough they consider themselves fierce rebels and pioneers of experience, all of Slaanesh’s servants are united in the same ultimate agenda – to see the realms reshaped as an endless dark paradise. Unlike the servants of the other Chaos Gods, they would not have reality as a single, all-encompassing annex of their deity’s home territory, for Slaanesh fears boredom and uniformity more than all other things.\\n\\nInstead they would engender a million forms of debauchery and over-indulgence, constantly venturing further into the depths of their own depravity – much to their master’s enjoyment. Regardless of what form these new purgatories would take – and it is uncertain that even Slaanesh knows from one day to the next – they would have one thing in common. All semblance of decency, purity and restraint would be outlawed, a distant memory defined only by failure and imminent death.\\n	false

The wanton indulgence of primal lusts appeals to many barbaric cultures, as well as many civilised ones.\\n\\nMusicians, artists, poets and dancers can all be seduced by the desire to perfect their skills. In doing so to the exclusion of all else – even their own humanity – they find Slaanesh. The ranks of these artful sinners are swollen by lost souls addicted to certain substances and unwholesome acts – those who gain momentary fulfilment from debauchery, only to find that they must surpass each former iteration of their indulgence to find true satisfaction.\\n\\nSome of those who keep their double lives or vices carefully hidden, upon reaching the point of no return, turn from secrecy to joyous and open celebration of that which they once sought so hard to hide. Those who think themselves infallible, or who rule with absolute authority, also gravitate towards Slaanesh, for the only thing true tyrants respect is an even greater tyrant with the power to depose them.\\n	false

It is well known that a battle can be a source of intense stimulus for those addicted to raw sensation. There can be found deafening noise and blinding light, thrilling hope and crushing despair, masochistic pain and sadistic pleasure.\\n\\nSlaanesh’s warriors drink in every nuance, glutting themselves on the most extreme experiences. They are infatuated with the act of killing, their eyes lighting with glee as they take life after life. In this, they are to be truly feared.\\n\\nThere is no chance of escape, nor of buying time through flattery, nor of promising fealty in exchange for mercy. Once a Warrior of Slaanesh has chosen their victim, they will do everything in their power to kill their quarry, even if it should mean their own demise.\\n\\nOn a wider scale, Slaanesh’s Warriors are preoccupied with the prospect of capturing territory, then defiling it and corrupting it as they pass. They lay waste to everything in their path, taking pride in the utter desolation they leave behind.\\n\\nThis is not done in an unthinking or automatic fashion, like the red wake of those devoted to Khorne, or the repulsive corpse-swamp left in the path of the followers of Nurgle. Instead it is a work of art, the battlefield a canvas upon which the Dark Prince’s devoted sew their tapestry of disaster.\\n\\nIn the wake of a Slaaneshi host, artfully dismembered cadavers are left in grisly tableaux. Some are arranged in symmetrical patterns – whorls, spirals and rows of hacked-off limbs planted in great profusion like a field of hideous cacti. Others are left entangled, decapitated heads swapped one for another, the bodies of riders entwined with those of their steeds or arranged in formal clinches as if to hint at a courtly dance of death. In this kind of act the Warriors of Slaanesh find a hideous mirth, but also worship, for they know their deific master takes pleasure of his own in their twisted acts and black excesses.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_bloody_ascent_description	The Dark Prince’s hosts have uncounted numbers of figureheads, would-be leaders and aspiring conquerors at the forefront of their ranks. Each is a fierce rival of the others, despising and working against those that would rise above them.\\n\\nIn clandestine cults across the mortal world, these competitions for influence have the Machiavellian complexity, subtlety and lethal intrigue of those that once took place in the Palace of Slaanesh. When on the battlefield, however, they escalate into blistering shouting matches, in which insults and abuse are screamed in raw hatred.\\n\\nThe intensity and inventiveness of the barbs traded by rival Champions is so severe they would make even a Skaven sewer-worker gag in repulsion and shock. Some have been known to make the ears of mortals bleed with their sheer viciousness.\\n\\nSlaaneshi hosts are usually led by Keepers of Secrets. These greater daemons see themselves as the Dark Prince’s prophets, whose duty it is to go forth to spread the word of Slaanesh and despoil the lands to better reflect his preferences. At first, the Keepers may work well alongside their fellows, telling themselves that the ultimate goal of empowering Slaanesh is so important they must put aside their hateful feelings about their rivals.\\n\\nThis never lasts for long, for a Keeper of Secrets can no more be truly selfless than an abyssal kraken can survive in the blinding deserts of Araby. Before long, the sniping, backbiting and competing begins, each warlord trying to outdo the others and rise as supreme ruler.\\n\\nShould one of the figureheads that claims leadership over a Slaaneshi host fall, their followers are claimed by the nearest rival. The power that belonged to the defeated warlord is transferred to the leader that claimed his vanquished rival was inferior all along.\\n\\nWhether this happens through a natural process of the strongest surviving, or through some mystical benediction of Slaanesh, is the subject of much debate among the supplicants. The most influential of their number are undeniably blessed, even if only with good luck, for they have seen dozens of would-be challengers perish before their eyes – and with each triumph their power base grows until they have not one army, but dozens, at their beck and call.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_number_of_slaanesh_description	To Slaanesh, there is no aspect of numerical magic more alluring than six. Six are the circles of his domain in the Realm of Chaos; six are the principal seductions by which he enthrals his devotees.\\n\\nWhen his legions go to war, they often do so in groups of this sacred number, with each army subjecting its foes to a different form of torment in accordance with a wider tapestry of disaster. The grandest plans of Slaanesh usually play out in six phases, each serving as a single movement in a symphony of anguish that, when viewed in total, is far greater and more depraved than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nOn some unconscious level, mortal followers of the Prince of Pleasure also consider six to be the most beautiful number, augmenting their flesh with six-fold scars, or slicing their tongues into six branching forks that they might better speak the sibilant version of the Dark Tongue that is favoured by Slaaneshi daemons.\\n\\nAmongst the sadists and masochists that consider themselves connoisseurs of sensation, it is said that there are six hundred and sixty-six types of pleasure and pain, all of which must be experienced to achieve true communion with their debauched god.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_darkling_muse_description	The most adroit Cultists of Slaanesh present themselves as muses to artists who strive to create beauty amidst the horrors of the world. In feeding the artist’s passions, the Cultist allows their craft to flourish, bringing out of them the greatness that had always lain dormant.\\n\\nAt first they come to the artists in their dreams, stripping them of their inhibitions and magnifying the ambition and obsession buried deep within their souls. The Cultist then places in their minds a vision of the perfect piece of music that they will one day compose, an opus so idyllic that it will end wars and unite empires, or a battle hymn so bellicose that soldiers will march in their millions just to hear its rousing notes.\\n\\nThose the Cultist visits in person enter a state of utter bliss. Many die of starvation, having forsaken food and drink as they toil at their masterpiece. Others are reduced to gibbering lunatics, their minds and souls unable to bear the weight of their beauteous undertaking.\\n\\nEventually, when only a single musician remains, the Cultist reveals its true self. The pupil then learns that, in order for their great work to be completed, they must become the instrument of its execution, and give over their flesh to be played by the muse.\\n\\nThe instrument wrought from the contorted body of that willing subject is known as a heartstring lyre. Strung with tattered fragments of that mortal’s soul, the lyre emits screams of pure elation and raw torment that vibrate through the physical and spiritual essences of those who hear them.\\n\\nBy playing a cacophonous medley of notes, the Cultist conducts each individual muscle and nerve fibre in the foe to dance to its own anarchic rhythm, ripping the body apart. Alternatively, the instrument can emit a focused blast of sound that resounds within the very soul, vivifying the victim’s emotions to such an extent that their joy can no longer be contained, and their heart erupts in a shower of glorious gore.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_willing_prey_description	“What in Sigmar’s name is that thing?” Odlec Rendersen looked out over the rolling, autumnal fields towards the woods beyond, squinting at the immensity that was even now emerging from the shadow of the mountain.\\n\\n“Some kind of daemon, like enough,” replied Grigg Thundermane, expertly reloading the modest fort’s second cannon. “Whatever it is, it’s dead.”\\n\\nRendersen wasn’t so sure about that. The sound of chanting – that damnable, repetitive chanting that had robbed his sleep for the last three days – was growing louder, as if goading the monstrous thing that had emerged from the woods to action. He knew it too well, by now. Its cadence was impossible to get it out of his head.\\n\\n“Charr-Sha-Gansa Slan-a-zar!” The same phrase, over and over. He’d found himself saying it now and again, when no-one else was around. “Charr-Sha-Gansa Slan-a-zar!”\\n\\n“I’ll bet a month’s wages it’s called Charsha-gansa Slarna-something,” said Thormraz, the beardling sent to act as their powder monkey.\\n\\nOdlec shot him a black look, then stared back out at the field. A shaft of light was streaming through the cloud-choked skies, illuminating the creature as if the heavens themselves were looking directly upon it. It was perhaps forty feet tall, with six slender limbs and an elongated, bovine head. It gave a low moan as if in anticipation as it broke into a graceful, loping run. Somehow, despite its hideous anatomy, it was the most beautiful thing Odlec had ever seen.\\n\\nGrigg’s bass tone broke his reverie. “Well?”\\n\\n“Right!” said Odlec, tugging at his clothing; it felt way too tight. “Yes! Open fire!”\\n\\nThe cannon boomed a moment later, the explosive cylinder hurtling towards the thing even as its brother gun spoke a second later. The towering white daemon leaned to one side with impossible quickness, the first shot whipping past its hip, which was adorned with piercings. The other shell it caught in its claw as if it were snatching a falling leaf from the air.\\n\\n“Grungni’s beard,” breathed Odlec. “That’s not good.”\\n\\nHe watched wide-eyed as the creature raised the iron cylinder to its maw, leaned back its head, and swallowed it, before licking its lips in satisfaction. Then, with a great roar of adulation, hundreds of pale, near-naked revellers poured out from the treeline. Some were human, some half-beast in the manner of the forest people. Others were daemonic. Nothing else could look so vile and so alluring all at the same time. Yet they were but insects next to the magnificence of their lord.\\n\\nAfter another few seconds of watching the titanic god stride forwards, Odlec nodded as if finally confirming a supposition. Then, slicking back his hair with spit and straightening his tunic, he abandoned his position and went downstairs to open the portcullis, a singular phrase upon his lips that he muttered louder and louder until it became a shout.\\n\\n“Charr-Sha-Gansa Slan-a-zar!”\\n	false

gen_lore_nur_daemons_of_nurgle_description	The daemons of Nurgle are plague-infested abominations, beings of sanity-blasting foulness whose stench alone is enough to stun a Demigryph. They exist solely to spread the myriad contagions of their master to every corner of reality and beyond, a goal they pursue with single-minded determination. Their mere presence is enough to spark epidemics that devastate nations, and when they march to battle together they are entropy and the misery of terminal sickness given physical form.\\n\\nYet for all their repugnance, the daemons of Nurgle are – by and large – neither as hateful nor as cruel as the other daemons of Chaos. Just as the most virulent malady kills without malice or distinction, so too do Nurgle’s daemons. They march to battle with a mixture of morose detachment and obscene good cheer, and the slaughter that they wreak amongst their foes is but a by-product of their desire to infect all with the dubious blessings of their magnanimous god.\\n\\nGreat Unclean Ones lead the parade, lumbering mountains of rancid flesh and seeping pustules crowned with splintered antlers of rotting bone. Echoes of their master, these greater daemons are monstrous and ebullient in equal measure, chortling at the antics of their lesser kin or singing in gurgling baritones even as they spew infectious filth across their enemies.\\n\\nPlaguebearers make up the shambling masses of Nurgle’s daemon legions. They are one-eyed grotesques whose distended bodies are home to myriad diseases, and they clutch dripping plague swords in their withered claws as they trudge toward the foe. The Plaguebearers are led by Heralds of Nurgle, who whirl clumsily through the ranks, cracking revolting jokes and playing discordant tunes upon their rasping gutpipes.\\n\\nPlague Drones thrum overhead, Plaguebearers mounted upon enormous Rot Flies that hurl pus-filled death’s heads into the enemy ranks. Beasts of Nurgle bound across the battlefield, each one a crushing mass of slime-slick muscle and lashing tentacles whose only desire is to hurl itself into the fray in search of living playthings.\\n\\nWherever the daemon legions of Nurgle march, a living carpet of Nurglings swarms towards the foe. Diminutive and mischievous, these jabbering mites fill the air with a gabbling cacophony barely less disturbing than their indescribable reek, and pour over the enemy lines in a biting, scratching tide.\\n	false

gen_lore_nur_noxious_purity_description	For all the nauseating spectacle of their advance, one could be mistaken for believing Nurgle’s daemons to be less warlike than their counterparts. At first glance, they might seem plodding and cumbersome by comparison. Yet Nurgle’s children are every bit as dangerous as their rivals, just in very different ways.\\n\\nThe greatest strength of these abhorrent entities is their extraordinary resilience to damage. Volleys of arrows and hails of bullets rebound from their leathery hides, or simply lodge in layers of fat to little effect. Sword thrusts punch through rotted organs and muscle without causing the daemons any discomfort at all. Worse, as assailants try desperately to wrench their weapons free of the creatures’ blubber, they are showered with a deadly cocktail of diseased and corrosive bodily fluids.\\n\\nEven spellcraft, artillery fire or the talons of monstrous beasts can be confounded by the unholy resilience of Nurgle’s daemons. All the while, they advance inexorably upon their panicked enemies, before unleashing their own hideous weapons of war. These, unfortunately for all the denizens of the Mortal Realms, are manifold and truly repulsive.\\n\\nSome daemons wield plagueswords, weapons that drip with contagions so lethally infectious that a single nick or cut spells an agonising death. Others can vomit jetting floods of viscous bile to drown their enemies or else leave them mired in a sucking morass of lethal pestilence. Lashing tentacles, rotting fangs and filth-smeared claws batter and tear at the enemy, while paralytic mucus renders them helpless before the sorcerous contagions that billow around the daemons in choking clouds.\\n\\nBlinded by swarms of flies, deafened by the dull clangour of bells and gongs, choked by the putrid stench that thickens the air, many foes feel their sanity or courage reach breaking point. They turn to flee, screaming in revulsion and horror. Most are so riddled with disease that they will not get far, while those who do serve only to spread a bow wave of plague and sickness before the daemons’ advance.\\n\\nEven should an enemy stand their ground and succeed in striking down one of Nurgle’s daemons, the creature will not truly be slain. Instead, with its mortal shell torn asunder, the essence of the daemon is banished back to the Garden of Nurgle. There it must languish amidst fetor and filth, nothing more than an echo of its true power.\\n\\nEventually the cycles of rot and rebirth that sweep through Nurgle’s garden will see a banished entity recorporealise, though each sort of daemon that serves the Plague God is reborn in its own strange and horrible fashion. Some develop within quivering pupae that dangle amongst the sagging foliage of steaming swamps, while others manifest as embryonic growths suspended within the yolk-like pus of cysts that appear upon the hides of larger daemons. The only constant regarding these resurrections is how unutterably disgusting they are to those who do not share Nurgle’s particular eye for beauty.\\n	false

gen_lore_nur_avatars_corruption_description	The Realm of Chaos is an abomination beyond the imaginings of mortals. The armies of the Dark Gods march across splinters of sundered reality. They fight over endless fields of skulls that sprawl in the shadow of titanic metal volcanoes. They make war through multifaceted crystalline labyrinths in which every thought and deed sends a thousand shattered reflections cascading into madness.\\n\\nThey clash in foetid jungles where the plants are formed from soul-stuff and squirming insects, and across landscapes of rippling flesh that split open to devour combatants or discharge geysers of perfumed ichor that rain down as glittering jewels. Amidst such riotous insanity, even the hardiest mortal armies would not long survive. Thus it is that Nurgle sends his daemon legions – the Plague Legions – to fight his battles against his brother gods.\\n\\nWhen battling in the Realm of Chaos, Nurgle’s armies are notable for their stolid organisation and relentlessness. For all their eccentricities, the Great Unclean Ones that lead the Plague Legions to war are highly intelligent beings who understand well the cut and thrust of war.\\n\\nThey view the enemy’s forces like a disease might view a crowd of potential victims, were it possessed of malign intent. The foe must be worn down by increments, gradually lumbered with ever greater corruptions until they perish under the unbearable weight of their afflictions. Meanwhile, the enemy’s every effort to halt the Plague Legions’ advance or drive them back must be resisted, lest the foe cure themselves of the infection.\\n\\nThrough fell magics, the lords of Nurgle’s legions cloud the air with poisonous miasmas and roaring fly-storms to conceal their warriors. They summon vast constructs fashioned from chaotic energies, snail-like monstrosities the size of mountains with pox-ridden castles lurching upon their backs, or else flood the field with diseased slime, the better to mire the daemons of rival gods. So are Nurgle’s battles in the Realm of Chaos fought, whether he is invading his brothers’ domains or defending the tumbledown walls of his garden. \\n	false

gen_lore_nur_servants_decay_description	There are many reasons why the denizens of the Mortal Realms turn to the worship of Nurgle. Since the Age of Chaos began, myriad epidemics have swept across the lands. Believing themselves abandoned by the gods they once worshipped and scorning the ineffectual ministrations of their healers, many mortals have offered desperate prayers to Nurgle. The Plague God has alleviated the suffering of such unfortunates – if not their symptoms – but only at the cost of their souls, and of their eternal service to him.\\n\\nOthers, seeing their homes and lands despoiled, have given in to despair. Nurgle welcomes all such wretches, teaching them first to appreciate, then to cherish the entropy and rot that surrounds them, and to spread it far and wide as the gift it truly is.\\n\\nThe twisted and disfigured, the spiteful and forsaken, the hopelessly insane; all embrace the paternal comfort offered by Grandfather Nurgle, and willingly draw strength from the foul blessings that he rains down upon them.\\n\\nNot all who enter Nurgle’s service do so intentionally. In his own chortling fashion, Nurgle is the master of manipulating good intentions to gruesome ends. Many are the physicians, alchemists and holy men who seek to better understand the nature of disease, hoping to halt the spread of plague.\\n\\nNurgle is only too happy to offer his forbidden secrets to such individuals, tempting them ever further down paths of bitter revelation until their good intentions curdle along with their souls. All this has led tribes, villages, even entire cities to turn to the worship of Nurgle. Throughout the Chaos Wastes, immense armies of flyblown warriors march into battle, crying out praise to the Plague God.\\n\\nDread Fortresses are captured in Nurgle’s name, their walls slick with ooze, their battlements shot through with sentient corrosion. Slinking plague-cults infiltrate cities across the world, gathering in deep sewer chambers to perform unclean rites and taint waterways with virulent filth.\\n\\nPestilential Brayherds haunt trackless forests, despoiling all that is green and good. Enclaves of civilisation are torn down or corrupted from within. Vast and noble beasts are brought low by the weapons of sickness and entropy. All of these terrible deeds are intended to please Nurgle and thus earn his favour.\\n\\nSome warriors of Nurgle are blessed simply for laying a mighty hero low in battle, or driving Nurgle’s enemies from the field in disarray. This is rare, however, for simple martial conquest is a little crude for Nurgle’s tastes.\\n\\nRather than see another god’s champion slain, he would prefer they were infected with some strain of his poxes, so that their only hope is to forsake whichever of Nurgle’s brothers they worship and give their allegiance to him instead. More than just defeating an enemy army in battle, Nurgle prefers to see its soldiers infected with choice contagions, and enough of their number left alive that – in their panicked flight – they taint their allies’ strongholds, and spread his gifts to all those they encounter.\\n\\nAmongst the ranks of Nurgle’s mortal servants are those who have poisoned the rations of their former comrades with plague spores, infected the drinking water of strongholds, and raised statues of soiled warpstone the better to reduce places of magical beauty to bubbling slime.\\n	false

gen_lore_nur_worship_through_desecration_description	Warriors of Nurgle exhibit a gallows humour and a joy in their work, stemming from an acceptance that, inevitably, all must rot and perish. This malignant mirth is entirely at odds with the way in which they make war, showing neither mercy nor forgiveness to those who would oppose Grandfather Nurgle.\\n\\nThe Warriors of Nurgle crush the Urfather’s enemies wherever they encounter them, despoiling everything their foes hold dear. They hew through the warbands of Nurgle’s brother gods, spreading the blessings of disease and decay as widely as they can in the hopes of securing converts from amongst the enemy ranks. Where they encounter temples and shrines to other deities, they desecrate them with muck and mire, making examples of any attendant priests and holy men to cow the flocks of unfaithful.\\n\\nNurgle’s mortal armies go to special pains to taint sites of life-giving power, such as oases, rivers and farmlands, for to successfully imbue such places with Nurgle’s gifts is to spread them far and wide using the natural cycles of life. To further propagate their god’s corruptions, Nurgle’s followers excavate vast earthworks known as Filth Pits that are bored using chained daemon-wyrms.\\n\\nThese deep holes look, from above, like the sigil of Nurgle writ large in leprous craters. Their sides are sheer and slippery with unspeakable substances, while their depths sit several feet deep in a parasite-infested gruel that bubbles and pops as it gives off clouds of airborne contagions.\\n\\nNot only do Filth Pits poison the land for miles around, but they are also used by followers of Nurgle as sacrificial sites. Captive warriors are flung into their depths, there to suffer one horrible pox and infestation after another until at last they perish in miserable agony. Such drawn-out suffering offers great praise to Nurgle, and gradually wears thin the weave of reality, creating weak points through which the Plague God’s daemons can more easily be summoned.\\n	false

Though sometimes they enslave diseased Brayherds or foully tainted monsters, more commonly the Nurglites forge temporary pacts with the Skaven of the Clans Pestilens.\\n\\nThough ultimately Nurgle and the Horned Rat seek different ends, the followers of both deities employ disease and despair as weapons of war, and so fight well together upon the field of battle. Often the Nurglites will allow their ratmen allies to surge ahead in a chittering horde, suffering the brunt of the enemy’s wrath and overrunning their lines before their mortal warriors and daemons wade in to strike the killing blow.\\n\\nAt other times, the Clans Pestilens will support Nurglite attacks with vile magics and batteries of plague-flinging war machines. Yet always the servants of Nurgle must keep a wary eye on their opportunistic allies, for the slightest sign of weakness is enough to spur the Skaven to violent acts of betrayal.\\n	false

Then does the mouldering curtain part, and rusted gate creak open to the Garden Glorisome. Then shall the Tallymen trudge out, to bear Grandfather’s givings hence.

gen_lore_brt_grail_chapel_description	Throughout Bretonnia are to be found chapels dedicated to the Lady of the Lake and the grail known as “grail chapels”. These may be built near to a place where a vision of the Lady of the Lake has appeared, or in a town or village or even within a castle. These will usually be the pious foundations of Knights who either hope one day to succeed on the grail quest, or who have returned.\\n\\nMany of these chapels are to be found in remote locations hidden in the forest near to a place believed sacred to the Lady of the Lake. Grail chapels have been built throughout the history of Bretonnia, so many are very old indeed. There are even a few which date back before the time of Gilles le Breton.\\n\\nSome of the more remote grail chapels have become ruined and completely overgrown and forgotten. This is especially true in the forests and regions which have been ravaged by enemies and subsequently recaptured. Often all record or memory of the location of the original grail chapel has been lost, and the new Knight will build a new chapel.\\n\\nOne day a Questing Knight may stumble upon the old chapel with its relics while seeking the grail. Since grail chapels are often near to places where the Lady of the Lake appears, Questing Knights deliberately seek out old grail chapels or may be led to them in visions and dreams.\\n\\nWithin the ruinous crypts they may find magical weapons, relics placed there by former Grail Knights who may even be entombed in the very same chapel. Such relics are regarded as quest rewards from the Lady of the Lake.\\n\\nGrail Knights may choose to become Hermit Knights, living in a remote grail chapel guarding the relics housed within it and the bones of former Grail Knights buried within its catacombs. Such Hermit Knights defend the grail chapels from evil foes who might try to take the relics or even the bones for their own vile sorcery.\\n\\nFortunately, the bones of Grail Knights are incorruptible and cannot be bent to evil will, but sepulchres attract raiders, usually Undead or Skaven, looking for whatever they might find and desecrating the sanctity of the shrine in the process.\\n\\nOver the centuries, some grail chapels have been enlarged as various nobles have rebuilt old chapels or embellished existing shrines. Such chapels, often called abbeys of the grail, may contain so many valuable relics that they require defences in the manner of a castle and several Hermit Knights to guard them.\\n\\nIn addition, the chapel may attract a small number of female recluses known as Damoiselles du Grail, who seek to devote themselves to the Lady of the Lake. These will often be the daughters and sisters of Knights who, because they are not Knights, are not able to express their devotion by going on the grail quest.\\n\\nInstead, they become nuns of the grail. Their main work is to heal the wounded Knights carried in from the battlefield or the jousting field and to provide sanctuary and refreshment for the many Questing Knights that roam the land of Bretonnia.\\n\\nThey also minister to the religious needs of the peasantry and Knights, such as blessing ploughs and swords and banishing imps from village wells and bread ovens with water from the Lady of the Lake’s sacred pools and springs!\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_lady_lake_description	The Lady of the Lake is an awesome figure of Bretonnian myth and legend. All Bretonnians, whether Knights or commoners, respect and honour the Lady of the Lake. To the Knights, she is the goddess of honour and virtue who always favours the brave and shuns the dishonourable. For the common peasants, she is an angel who protects them, an unearthly spirit who breathes life into their fields, orchards and vineyards.\\n\\nWorship of this goddess dates back to ancient times, as far back as the stone age ancestors of the Bretonnians. On the fringes of Bretonnian territory, in the Grey Mountains and in the towns and cities, other gods such as those of the Empire gained a small foothold, but in the vast heartland of the Bretonnian countryside the Lady of the Lake still reigns supreme.\\n\\nIt is only in the verdant depths of the Bretonnian countryside that the Lady of the Lake manifests herself. She appears in those places where the earth energy wells forth to the surface and overflows. This magical energy is visible in the form of a swirling white mist or vapour. Thus the Lady appears to rise up from the depths of lakes and pools, springs of sweet water, among groves of trees and within the ancient stone circles erected by the ancestors of the Bretonnians.\\n\\nFew are privileged to see the Lady appear, and those who have seen her are regarded as especially favoured. Only those whose devotion, courage and extreme virtue have moved the Lady will be honoured enough to enter her presence.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_seek_and_find_description	The places where the Lady appears are always remote and isolated spots, usually deep in the forest or beside mountain pools. Only those who are prepared to face great perils are ever likely to find them. It is widely believed that anyone seeking the Lady can only find her if she leads him to her by means of dreams and visions.\\n\\nTo those who have seen her, the Lady of the Lake appears as a woman of exceptional beauty. She rises majestically from the lake or wafts into the wooded glade on the swirling mist. She is radiant like the moon and speaks by gestures rather than words. In her hands she carries a shining chalice brimming over with liquid light – the grail. Those most favoured by the Lady will be approached by her and she will hold the grail to their lips. They can then sip the enchanted energy from the grail with miraculous results.\\n\\nThe Lady of the Lake has been sought for and found many times in Bretonnian history. Each encounter passes into the legend, enriching it further. Over countless centuries, the lore of the Lady of the Lake and her sacred grail have become the dominant religion of Bretonnia. Chapels to the grail are found in every village, and the symbolism of the Lady and the grail is to be seen everywhere.\\n\\nThe Lady of the Lake and the grail are fundamental to the Bretonnian code of chivalry. Although the code of chivalry and the rules of honour grew out of the Bretonnian traditions of knighthood and warrior virtues, these are entwined with the legends of the Lady of the Lake.\\n\\nIt is she who rewards honour and virtue. To seek honour is a devotion to her which will ultimately win her favour. A Knight who dies having served and honoured the lady all the days of his life is believed to become one of her avenging angels, continuing to serve her through all eternity.\\n\\nThe highest pinnacle of chivalry in Bretonnia is to become favoured by the Lady of the Lake. A Knight who is prepared to go on a perilous quest to seek for the lady may ultimately find her and sip from her grail, becoming almost invincible. Such Knights defend honour and virtue among mankind and protect the blessed land of Bretonnia in which the Lady dwells. They will not permit evil to profane her sacred places or offend her presence!\\n	false

It is recorded in Bretonnian annals that a wicked and foolish Knight claimed to have possession of the grail.\\n\\nIn reality, it was a false grail with which he intended to fool and confuse good and virtuous Knights so that he could wrongfully seize the throne of Bretonnia. He met his well-deserved fate at the hands of the Grail Knights, servants of the true grail. This episode has passed into Bretonnian history as the “Affair of the False Grail”.\\n\\nFrom time to time, Questing Knights return from their wanderings bearing ancient golden cups or similar items which they have found in old burial mounds or glinting on the bottom of forest ponds. Such things do not fool Grail Knights, who have seen the true grail and know its true appearance. Such false grails are revealed for what they are by Knights of the true grail, and their finders must return to their quest or be disgraced.\\n	false

She is the very spirit of Bretonnia, who rewards the brave and destroys the craven. Those who go to battle with her blessing will triumph over their enemies, even if they are outnumbered hundreds to one!\\n\\nTo the Bretonnians, this is a just and natural state of affairs. Were they to consider the matter at all, they might say that the magical forces that flow through the land are drawn and concentrated by the faith of the people who love and protect it.\\n\\nThe land’s spirit is formed from the magical energy that flows through it, and that spirit is nothing less than the Lady of the Lake herself. This sacred power flows from the Lady’s chalice, the grail to which all chivalry aspires.\\n\\nJust as an individual Knight can gain the favour of the Lady of the Lake, so an entire army can be blessed so long as its leader is virtuous and his warriors pure of heart. When so many honourable Knights go to war, swearing to fight to the death to uphold their ideals and defend what is right, no matter what the odds, then very great amounts of virtuous magic are attracted to them.\\n\\nThis can manifest itself as a shimmering mist rising from the ground, like the morning mist of a summer day. The Lady of the Lake may even appear as a vision before the entire army, glimmering in the hazy ether to bless the warriors of Bretonnia.\\n\\nBefore a battle, the Bretonnian Knights kneel and pray to the Lady of the Lake, avowing to fight to the death for honour and justice. It is an awesome sight to behold the mists of magic seep from the ground in response to the Bretonnians’ affirmation of faith.\\n\\nThe enemy can but watch with dread as rays of sunlight break through the clouds, glinting on the armour and dancing upon the lance tips of the Bretonnian host, stirring an otherworldly chorus from the very earth itself.

From these ports and cities, the Elves traded with the Dwarfs of the mountains and both nations flourished.\\n\\nYet, when war between the two races broke out, the Dwarfs besieged and destroyed the cities of the Elves, forcing their inhabitants to retreat back from whence they came, beyond the ocean waves. With their victory won, the Dwarfs, tired from a long and vicious war, withdrew to their mountain realm and left the land barren in their wake.\\n\\nIn the centuries that followed, the land became a wilderness, occupied by roving Orcs and primitive humans. Of these humans, it was the Bretonni tribe, the ancestors of the Bretonnians, which would emerge as the most powerful.\\n\\nOver long centuries of warfare, the Bretonni won the fertile plains and valleys in the teeth of violent opposition from the Orcs, pushing their enemies into the inhospitable forests and uplands. Yet, the Orcs always returned, and new enemies emerged to threaten the tribes in the form of raiders from across the seas – vicious Norscans from the frozen north, and ancient Undead from the sweltering south.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_warrior_elite_description	In the ancient days before Bretonnia’s founding, the Bretonni tribes ruled the lands. Even as the their enemies grew in number, many amongst them became less warlike. Gradually, the people adopted the ways of farming and animal husbandry, growing fat on the bounty of their labour and weak in the face of aggression. Thus would the Bretonni, eager to keep their hard won lands and defend their farms and villages from aggressors, adapt to overcome their enemies.\\n\\nIt became the custom that the most stout-hearted and belligerent amongst the Bretonni – those more concerned with hefting weapons than tools – would live as warriors, ever armed and ready to defend against rampaging enemies. Whilst these warriors split their days between sparring with their comrades and keeping silent vigil over their homes from tall watchtowers behind palisade walls, those of a less martial demeanour toiled to provide for their chosen champions. Thus, the guardians of the Bretonni grew broad of shoulder and strong of limb, for they dined on the richest meat and finest wine that their people could produce through their toil.\\n\\nAnd they grew wealthy, gifted with the most well-crafted of weapons and armour that their people could provide through their labour. The tall watchtowers they occupied grew to become stone-built keeps, around which clustered the humble abodes of those they protected, and the finest pasture was preserved for their warhorses whilst herds of cattle looked on in bovine bemusement.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_code_chivalric_description	Before the founding of Bretonnia, the Bretonni tribes fell under attack by hordes of foreign invaders from both land and sea. Those among them who had been elevated as warriors by their kin began to take on the duties of leaders amongst their people, and their people were grateful to them for shouldering such troublesome responsibilities.\\n\\nYet, humility and honour drove these knights, as they came to be called, to be always grateful for their lives of privilege, for whilst they must sometimes face great peril, they were fortunate indeed for the luxuries they enjoyed. Accordingly, these knights adopted a code of honour, laid down by the champions of the largest towns and villages.\\n\\nThis code would formalise the arrangement between the knights and their people, and they would swear binding vows to adhere to this code, provided the people agreed to maintain them in the style to which they had grown accustomed.\\n\\nIn the time of Gilles le Breton, the code of Bretonnia’s knights grew in importance, taking on a religious quality under the influence of the Lady of the Lake, the goddess revered by the land’s first king. These rules, including the first and most vital in the opinion of all pious knights of Bretonnia, were later recorded by one of Gilles’ heirs as the seven tenets of the Code Chivalric:\\n\\n• To serve the Lady of the Lake.\\n• To defend the land and those that dwell upon it.\\n• To protect the weak from the wicked.\\n• To always oppose the enemies of virtue and order.\\n• To never give up the fight, your foes unvanquished.\\n• To never break faith with a friend or ally.\\n• To always display honour and courtesy.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_rules_knightly_honour_subtitle	The Rules of Knightly Honour	false
gen_lore_brt_rules_knightly_honour_description	In addition to the seven sacred tenets of the Code Chivalric, the knights of Bretonnia have long chosen to be self-governed in their deeds by five ‘rules of honour’, recorded by one of Gilles’ heirs during the formalisation of the Code Chivalric. To these rules, all honest and noble knights must adhere at all times, treating them with as much respect as the tenets of chivalry:\\n\\n• A knight must honour the purity of hand-to-hand combat. An honourable knight must never meet a foe with slings or arrows.\\n• A knight must strive to accept every challenge to personal combat.\\n• A knight must never draw sword against a fellow knight, except in trial by combat or tourney.\\n• A knight must never submit to being taken captive.\\n• A knight must never retreat in fear, only to replace a shattered lance or retire a wounded mount.\\n\\nThe purpose of these rules, taken in conjunction with the tenets, is to ensure that knights maintain their personal honour at all times, be they facing the enemy upon the field of battle, or competing against their peers in a joyous test of arms. These rules and tenets teach a knight to always behave in a manner befitting their station, ensuring they enjoy the respect they deserve from all echelons of Bretonnian society, from the lowliest members of the peasant class, through the many and varied classes of freemen, such as merchants and artisans, up to and including their own knightly peers and superiors.\\n\\nSo great did the warrior pride of Bretonnia’s knightly class become, and so diligent and fervent did they grow in pursuit of the ideals of the Code Chivalric, that over the centuries, vast hosts of knights would cross the mountains bordering fair Bretonnia, crusading deep into the Empire, the Border Princes and the Badlands.\\n\\nOther crusades have embarked upon great galleons that have carried the knights of Bretonnia and their steeds into the faraway lands of Norsca, Araby and even the mysterious Land of the Dead. The purpose of such crusades is simple: to crush the enemies of Bretonnia before they can muster upon her sanctified borders and threaten the humble existence of the peasant masses.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_knightly_penance_description	For all their fervent adherence to the tenets of chivalry and the rules of honour, the knights of Bretonnia are but mere mortals. As such, it is not uncommon for a hot-tempered knight to grow wrathful and strike a fellow, or for a youthful knight to falter and flee before a foe.\\n\\nShould a knight break a rule of honour whilst under duress, such as in times of war, they will quickly seek to redeem themselves. For most knights, this redemption can be found in the undertaking of a noble quest or knightly errand, such as to seek out the Grail, or to hunt down and slay a vile beast.\\n\\nOthers may prefer to pledge themselves to the service of another knight, often of an inferior rank, and to remain in service until their patron deems their honour restored. Such penitent knights, as they are known, are a common sight in Bretonnia and easily recognised for many will obscure their heraldry beneath black paint and hide their colours under sackcloth surcoats.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_exiles_vow_description	Whilst time spent serving penance is not uncommon amongst the bellicose and prideful knights of Bretonnia, it is not the only punishment for a knight who breaks the rules of honour. For those whose offences are so great that no quest can hope to expunge their shame, there is but one punishment: banishment.\\n\\nCast beyond the borders of their homeland, banished knights are forced to wander the Old World for the remainder of their days, stripped of their heraldry and titles, their names and deeds no longer sung of. With their perpetrators purged from memory, even the greatest acts of dishonour can be forgotten, if not forgiven.\\n\\nYet for others, banishment is a choice. Many times a knight has refused to accept penance, believing their dishonour to be the fault of another, or their noble intentions have been gravely mischaracterised as ignoble by the unbending nature of the Code Chivalric. It is not uncommon for such knights to take the Exile’s Vow – removing themselves and their entire household from their homeland, undertaking great hardships to make a new home for them and their subjects in foreign lands.\\n\\nShould a knight take the Exile’s Vow, they are immediately considered by their peers to have proven their honour, for to willingly leave fair Bretonnia and reside in another land is unimaginable to the knightly class. Though their lands may be forfeit, their good and noble reputation shall be preserved always and, when they begin their long march into the unknown, accompanied by their closest family, their most loyal retainers and their devoted peasant-tenants, they are mourned by those left behind with the most profound sincerity.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_peasant_uprisings_subtitle	Peasant Uprisings	false
gen_lore_brt_peasant_uprisings_description	From time to time, the peasants rise in revolt. These uprisings almost always surprise the nobility, because the peasants have hidden the problems until they became unbearable. Thus, most nobles believe the revolts are inspired by greed or base ingratitude, and even the virtuous ones have no hesitation in using force to put them down. No peasant uprising has ever succeeded, because all the nobles help to put it down. They cannot countenance such a threat to their authority.\\n\\nBy far the most common cause of an uprising is insupportable taxes. If the taxes demanded by a lord condemn the peasants to starvation, they have nothing to lose by rising in revolt. Indeed, given the Bretonnian attitude, dying in battle is better than dying of starvation, so even if they lose, their condition improves. These uprisings are brutally suppressed; many of the surviving peasants are executed. As a result, the food stores are often sufficient to support the survivors.\\n\\nThe next most common cause is manipulation by other nobles. Peasant revolts never succeed, but they do distract a noble and draw his forces away, making an attack by another noble more likely to succeed. Some nobles simply promise better conditions once they have taken over; a small number even keep that promise. Others rely on manipulating their enemy into demanding excessive taxes or sabotage the harvest to make normal taxes unbearable, so that the peasants rise on their own account.\\n\\nForeign agitators and revolutionary sentiment are often blamed for uprisings, but in truth, they are hardly ever responsible. Foreign powers that wish to weaken Bretonnia have more effective means available than stirring up the peasantry, and political agitators are just rare.\\n\\nBy far the most dangerous uprisings are those inspired by the Ruinous Powers. Peasants with mutations – or worse, supported by Beastmen – can pose a serious threat even to the knights of Bretonnia. Such uprisings were briefly common during the Storm of Chaos, whilst much of the flower of Bretonnian chivalry was in the Empire fighting Archaon’s hordes. The returning knights have enthusiastically joined in stamping these out, and the few pockets of corruption that remain are small and isolated.\\n\\nIn normal times, the Ruinous Powers often find the subjects of brutal nobles to be the most receptive to the lures of Chaos. This can cause problems for those who have taken up the cause of the oppressed peasants, only to learn that they are allied with the forces of Chaos.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_vows_bretonnia_description	The social order of Bretonnia is determined by a series of creeds and tenets laid down hundreds of years ago in the time of Gilles the Uniter and formally recorded by his son Louis. Each stratum of Bretonnian society rigidly adheres to their particular code. However, due to the antiquity of the original documents, much can be misconstrued by the opportunistic or the foolish.\\n\\nThe lower orders of Bretonnian society, very few of whom are literate, will gather on the first day of each month to have their credo read to them by a squire or chamberlain. The peasants of Bretonnia live hand to mouth, toiling in the fields day in day out in absolute, destitute poverty. Most will not survive to see middle age, and theirs is a thankless role – yet without their produce and taxes the knights could ill afford to live in the manner to which they are accustomed.\\n\\nThe knights themselves are given to copying out their vows in painstaking illuminated scripts that they treat with reverential care. The knights recite these vows before an image or token of the Lady which, depending on the knight’s status, can range from a candlelit sketch to a gilded triptych. To break any aspect of their vows is the worst crime imaginable to these noble warriors.\\n\\nNo knight would willingly bring dishonour on his name, but should he be forced to betray his creed by foul circumstance he will often immediately take up the Questing Vow. The ascendance from one rank of knighthood to another is of the utmost import to the knights of Bretonnia. As such, no Grail Knight would willingly be led by a mere Questing Knight or, Lady forbid, a Knight of the Realm. Exceptions are rare, and in other matters a knight will generally bow to one of a more senior order.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_first_sighting_description	Since ancient times, the Bretonnians have worshipped the Lady of the Lake as their goddess, a figure of myth and legend who guides their kings and protects their land from harm. Worship of the Lady can be traced to the earliest days of the kingdom. It is said that she arose from a lake before Gilles le Breton and his knightly Companions on the dawn of the Great Victory of Bordeleaux.\\n\\nWreathed in a fey light, the Lady rose from the water bearing a grail which overflowed with light that spilled into the waters of the lake, blessing the assembled knights until dawn’s light broke over the mountains. Gilles famously dipped his bloodied and tattered banner into the radiant waters of the lake crying, “Lady, bless my banner!” only to lift it from the waters, magically restored and bearing the image of the Lady and her glittering grail.\\n\\nGilles and his knights rode out and defeated the Orcs, then returned to the lake after the battle to give thanks to the Lady for her blessing. And at this lake, he and his Companions swore great oaths to serve the Lady and remain together to free the land of Bretonnia from the monsters that assailed it.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Gilles and his knights went on to win many great victories and since those days, worship of the Lady has spread throughout Bretonnia. The Lady herself is very rarely seen, and only in the most verdant depths of the land may she be found by a few privileged and pure souls. Those who do find her are regarded as highly favoured and are themselves revered.\\n	false

Great clods of muddy earth were thrown up in their wake, and the sky darkened as a cloud of arrows streaked overhead and fell amongst the hated foe.\\n\\nAt the forefront of the charge, Leonhard felt the familiar surge of exhilaration as he rapidly closed the distance to the savage worshippers of the Chaos gods. Picking his target, a giant of a man screaming incoherently, Leonhard lowered his lance.\\n\\nThe warrior tried to step to the side, but the veteran knight had anticipated such a move. His lance punched into the warrior’s chest with the full weight of armoured knight and horse behind it, and lacquered wood ripped through the marauder’s body. Screams and shouts erupted, mingling with sounds of crunching bone and clashing steel as the other knights struck.\\n\\nHorses’ hooves flailed, caving in skulls and shattering bones, and knights hacked deep into flesh with every strike of their blades. Leonhard dropped the butt of his splintered lance and drew his sword. He kicked one warrior in the face and sunk his blade into the neck of another who was trying to grab his steed’s bridle.\\n\\nHis bloody blade rose and fell, killing with every blow. He sensed the sudden hesitation amongst the foe, saw the doubt written on their faces.

gen_lore_brt_trial_by_combat_description	Discipline and honour among Knights is maintained by the custom of trial by combat. If a Knight accused another of dishonour, the accuser and accused are required to fight in single combat. This can be fought to the death or until one Knight decides to spare his defeated opponent, having proved his honour. The contest may begin as a mounted joust at lance point and end with both Knights dismounted and battering each other with hand weapons.\\n\\nThe field of combat is ringed with men-at-arms forming a wall of shields who will not allow either contender to leave the field until the matter is decided and honour is satisfied. A superior lord, either a baron, duke or even the king, presides over the trial, depending on the rank of the contenders.\\n\\nMagic items are banned from the contest and as in a tournament, it is a serious offence to strike an opponent’s warhorse. If a defeated contender is spared and not slain he is punished with exile from the realm and may only redeem himself by pledging himself to a second Errand of knighthood. This is known as a Task of Redemption. Such tasks are usually extremely perilous!\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_bretonnian_tournaments_description	Bretonnian Knights like nothing better than a tournament, except perhaps a just and righteous war! Many tournaments are held in Bretonnia. The greatest of these are the royal tournaments held at Couronne twice or four times a year to mark the opening of a new season. Then there are the tournaments held by the various dukes and countless local tournaments held by barons.\\n\\nIt is possible for a Knight to roam the kingdom, entering one tournament after another, and if successful, being followed by a baggage train of prizes such as armour, treasure and warhorses, not to mention admirers, minstrels singing his praises and would-be grooms and squires hoping for a placement in his retinue.\\n\\nTournaments are often held in order to find a Knight worthy to wed the daughter of a duke or baron or even the king. Thus winning a tournament can be made the errand of knighthood for any Knights Errant who care to take part. If the tournament prize is not a lady’s hand or a domain and castle then it may be a magic weapon or a special honour.\\n\\nThe highlight of the tournament, which lasts several days and includes much feasting, hunting and carousing, is, of course, the jousts. Pairs of contenders challenge each other and fight on the jousting field. It is the custom to use blunted lances unless the joust is a trial by combat, or the rivalry between contenders is particularly bitter!\\n\\nEven so, wounds inflicted by being unhorsed can be severe. Sometimes retinues of Knights joust together in groups, giving a spectacle like a small battle. This provides excellent training for the Knights and keeps them at the peak of fighting fitness.\\n\\nIt is common custom for young and lusty Knights Errant to ride around the spectator stands asking ladies for their favours. These of course are not favours of the magical kind! The ladies attach various items of their apparel to the Knight’s lance. The more a Knight’s manly bearing and brave manner delight a lady, the more intimate the item of clothing she is moved to attach to his lance.\\n\\nIf he wins his round of combat, the Knight may find himself honour bound to wed the lady! By the time the contest begins, many ladies are feeling the cold somewhat, especially in the midwinter tournaments! All this makes for good bawdy ballads sung by the minstrels around the feasting fires after the tournament.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_bretonnian_warhorse_description	Bretonnian Knights have earned a rightful reputation for invincibility, and few other mounted troops can stand against them. It is even said that a charging Bretonnian knight at full gallop could smash his way through the walls of Karaz-a-Karak! The Bretonnians owe this renown to their own knightly ardour and valour, but also, and not least, they owe it to the magnificence of their mounts, the Bretonnian Warhorses.\\n\\nThe Bretonnian Warhorse is the finest breed of warhorse in the Old World. This is because the Bretonnian Warhorse is in part descended from the Elven steeds of the former Elven colonies, which flourished centuries ago in the land that is now Bretonnia.\\n\\nWhen the Elven colonists abandoned the Old World and sailed back to Ulthuan, some remained behind. These Elves were the ancestors of the Wood Elves of the Forest of Loren. One of the Elven kindreds that stayed took their Elven steeds with them into the safety of the forest glades. Elsewhere, herds of Elven steeds roamed freely in the meadows and plains around the abandoned Elven ruins, interbreeding with wild forest ponies. This mingling of blood eventually resulted in the creation of a new breed, the Bretonnian Warhorse.\\n\\nThis new breed of horse was far superior in size and spirit than any other in the Old World. The horses of the Empire are descended from the wild ponies of the Kislevite steppes and have no blood of the Elven steeds in their veins.\\n\\nThe warhorses of the Empire and Kislev are passable, but lack the power and spirit of the Bretonnian steed, although they are perhaps better suited to a harsher climate, while the Bretonnian breed need the lush meadows of the west. Similarly, Arabyan stallions and the Cathayan horses are also descended ultimately from the wild ponies of the Kislevite steppes and lack any blood from Elven stock.\\n\\nWhen the Bretonnian warriors began riding into battle on the native horses of Bretonnia, they found that the horses could bear the weight of a fully armoured man and still gallop and charge over and over again without tiring. The horses were big, powerful and not lacking in stamina.\\n\\nThe Bretonnian Knights therefore made every effort to maintain and improve their special breed. A very important factor in this was the peace pact with the Wood Elves of Athel Loren. By the terms of this pact, from time to time the Elves allow the Bretonnians to have some of their precious steeds. In this way, the Bretonnian horses are replenished with fresh blood from pure Elven stock.\\n\\nThis agreement is unique and unheard of anywhere else in the world. The High Elves of Ulthuan would not let any of their horses out of the country, although they cannot stop Dark Elf raiders stealing them. The Wood Elves, however, know that their realm is flanked by the Bretonnians, who protect Athel Loren as a bulwark.\\n\\nNo one gets into Athel Loren from the west without first having to fight through the Bretonnian Knights. From the Wood Elf point of view, this security is well worth a bit of horse trading. In return, the Elves acquire swords and other weapons of good Bretonnian iron and steel, which they do not make to any great extent in their own realm.\\n\\nBretonnian Warhorses are highly valued and are always reserved for Bretonnian Knights. Squires must make do with forest ponies and lesser breeds lacking the blood of the Elven Steeds. The King of Bretonnia has banned anyone from taking Bretonnian Warhorses out of the realm.\\n\\nAnyone who does, be they subject or foreigner, can expect an army of angry Bretonnian Knights to come after him to bring them back. The Bretonnian Knights naturally do not want anyone else to be as well mounted as they are. Even so, you would have to have the stature and nobility of a true Bretonnian Knight to ride a Bretonnian Warhorse; they do not put up with lesser warriors on their backs!\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_oriel_description	It is said that the most magnificent warhorse that ever lived was Oriel, favourite mount of King Guillaume. Long is the Chanson of Guillaume, for in his youth he burned with an insatiable lust for adventure and spent years exploring the lands he would inherit, riding from the white cliffs of Lyonesse right across to the Grey Mountains.\\n\\nThe 332nd verse of the chanson tells how Guillaume chanced upon a band of Orcs attacking some Wood Elves in the hilly lands of the Massif Orcal. Without a thought for his own safety, the fearless young prince charged straight into the fray, skewering five Orcs on his lance with his first attack.\\n\\nIn the bloody struggle that followed, Guillaume and the Elves eventually drove off the Greenskins. The Elves were grateful to their rescuer, for one of their party was Eoth, a prince of their kind. In thanks for his help, the Elves gifted Guillaume with a white colt to replace his horse, which had been fatally wounded in the fighting.\\n\\nWithin a year, the white colt had grown into a magnificent stallion, bigger and more beautiful than any other horse in Bretonnia. In his stable, Oriel was so gentle that a child could sit on his back, but in battle he was like a raging wind, so proud and furious that the king’s enemies would run in terror at the mere sight of the massive horse and his mailed rider.\\n\\nOriel lived to a great age and sired many fine foals. The white stallions that are traditionally ridden by Bretonnian kings can all be traced back to him. Indeed, one of the many duties of the College of Heralds is to record the lineage of the warhorses bred by the royal stud. Horse breeding is taken very seriously by the nobility, who constantly vie with each other to breed bigger and fiercer horses to carry the Bretonnian Knights into battle.\\n	false

Leaving his horse to drink its fill from the cool waters, the Questing Knight wandered a short distance from the stream, lost in thought.\\n\\nFor the past two weeks, Francois had travelled the depths of the Forest of Arden in search of a fabulous white hart that he had seen often in his dreams. Why the Lady of the Lake had granted him these visions he could not say, but Francois was certain his quest for the beautiful creature was somehow linked to his quest for the grail itself.\\n\\nUnfortunately, he had seen no trace of the animal since venturing into the forest, and now, tired and hungry, he was beginning to think he was wasting his time.\\n\\nDispirited, Francois turned to go back and then stopped in shock, gazing upon the wondrous form of the white hart itself, standing scant feet away from him and regarding him with soft, intelligent eyes. All about him, Francois could sense a stillness in the forest, as if everything, even the wind, had paused to watch what he would do next.\\n\\nWith growing apprehension, Francois realised he did not know what to do. The Knight had been so consumed by the chase that he had not paused to consider what he would actually do if he found the hart.\\n\\nIn his soul, he knew confronting the creature meant something important, but he was unsure how it would aid him in his quest for the grail.

gen_lore_brt_pomp_circumstance_description	The matter of which is the longest chanson, the Chanson of Guillaume or the Chanson of Gilles, has never been satisfactorily resolved. The debate is at its fiercest during the long winter evenings, when the noble families and their retainers cluster around the castle fire to keep warm and are entertained by minstrels and travelling players.\\n\\nThe Bretonnians are a very proud people and will go to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate their personal wealth and social standing. Each duke and baron thinks he is better than his neighbour and will take every opportunity to flaunt his superiority by constantly improving his castle, recruiting more men-at-arms, and equipping his Knights with the best weapons, armour and warhorses he can afford. This exaggerated sense of pride permeates every level of society, so that even the humblest peasant toiling in the field fervently believes that his cabbages are greener, plumper and tastier than his neighbour’s.\\n\\nA Bretonnian minstrel’s worth is rated by memory and endurance, hence the importance of a chanson’s length. The best minstrels are universally adjudged to be those who can sing for longest, not necessarily those who can sing in tune, or play their lute well. In fact, a common insult in the Empire is to accuse somebody as being “as boring as a Bretonnian minstrel”.\\n\\nEach duke and baron has his own minstrel, who sings chansons glorifying the exploits of his lord and all his ancestors. A simple ditty can last for half an hour, a chanson de bataille can take several hours, while a full-blown chanson, describing the life and times of an illustrious hero of the past, can last right into the early hours of the morning.\\n\\nThe noble ladies enjoy these songs much more than their menfolk, who tend to nod off half way through the evening, or are forced to make up feeble excuses about having to “check the meutrieres aren’t blocked” or “hoist the petard” so they can leave the room, take the cheese out of their ears and slope off to bed.\\n	false

These Elves established the secret realm of Athel Loren hidden deep in the Forest of Loren, which endures to this day.\\n\\nThe Dwarfs gained little from the retreat of the Elves. Their own homeland in the Worlds Edge Mountains was devastated by earthquake and volcanic eruption. Soon afterwards, many of the strongholds in the Old World fell to Orcs, Goblins and other enemies. Even to this day, there are no more than one or two Dwarf strongholds west of the Grey Mountains.\\n\\nThus the western part of the continent was left open for settlement by new peoples. Into this wilderness came tribes of Orcs, Goblins and men, among them the warlike and noble Bretonni. Ahead of them lay many centuries of struggle against the Orcs and Goblins for possession of the best and most fertile lands. During this dark time the Bretonni learned how to forge metal weapons, ride horses into battle and build strongholds of stone.\\n\\nEven while Sigmar was welding the tribes east of the Grey Mountains into an Empire, the Bretonni were still divided under the rule of several independent dukedoms. These often fought each other when they would have been better off uniting against the Orcs. The dukes and their Knights dominated the fertile valleys and plains, while the Orcs and Goblins infested the forests, hills, mountains and wilderness regions. It was impossible to travel from one duke’s territory to another without going through land controlled by the Orcs.\\n\\nAll this was to change around the time of Gilles le Breton, the legendary ‘leader of battles’ who forged the Bretonnians into a single nation and laid the foundations of the kingdom of Bretonnia.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_gilles_le_breton_description	In the Imperial year 977 or thereabouts, it is said that Gilles le Breton began to unite the Bretonnians into a single nation. What is known about Gilles is a mixture of fact and fable. Knowledge of reading and writing has never been widespread in Bretonnia, and the early history of the realm was not written down until centuries after the events. For a long time, the story of Gilles was a legendary saga sung by travelling troubadours touring the castles of Knights, reciting the ‘Chanson de Gilles’ in which his exploits are celebrated.\\n\\nAccording to the ‘Chanson de Gilles’, the Orc and Goblin tribes hatched a conspiracy to conquer and enslave the Bretonnians. The Orcs struck all the dukedoms at once, so that none of the dukes could come to the assistance of any other. Indeed, the dukes hardly had time to gather together Knights to defend their own dukedoms.\\n\\nBrave though they were, the Knights of that time were unable to turn back the Orcs and many fell defending their castles and domains in small hastily gathered armies or even alone. The dukedoms of the north were overrun. To make matters worse, Chaos raiders crossed the Sea of Claws and began ravaging the northern coasts, attacking with uncanny timing and accuracy.\\n\\nAt roughly the same time, the Tomb King Settra’s fleet appeared once more off the western shores. No sooner had the Orcs and Goblins rampaged through the region than the Undead hordes completed the desolation. In the east and south, restless Goblin tribes came down out of the Grey Mountains to pillage and burn.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_their_darkest_hour_description	As the lands of fair Bretonnia burned, Gilles, Duke of Bastonne, moved quickly to gather his Knights together into an army. This army had already fought several battles against the Orcs and was now patching its wounds beside a small lake in the margins of the Forest of Chalons. Here Gilles was joined by several other dukes with the tattered remnants of their armies.\\n\\nTheir own lands had been devastated, and so they had ridden to fight beside Gilles in one last battle against the enemy. As night fell, the bellowing of Orc warhorns could be heard in the distance. The next day would decide the fate of Bretonnia. The Knights shared what little food and wine they had left and snatched what rest they could.\\n\\nDawn came and the sunlight woke them. They saw that the lake was enshrouded in a swirling mist. They put on their armour and prepared to fight the last battle. The horses were led to the lake edge to drink and the Knights knelt to drink beside them.\\n\\nSuddenly, the vapours rising from the water condensed into the form of a lady of incomparable beauty. The Knights were awestruck by the vision, and all were filled with a strange calm. In her hands the lady held a gleaming chalice overflowing with light which cascaded down like liquid into the water of the lake. Some Knights cupped their hands to drink from the lake and soon the rest followed suit.\\n\\nGilles quickly took up the tattered war banner that hung from his lance and held it out towards the vision. With the words, ‘Lady, bless my banner!’, he dipped the blood-drenched rag into the lake. When he raised it again, the entire host of Knights gasped. They now beheld a new gleaming banner bearing the image of the Lady of the Lake as an awesome, avenging goddess. As soon as they saw this other Knights began dipping their weapons in the water saying ‘Lady, bless my sword’, ‘Bless my lance’ and ‘Bless my warhorse!’.\\n\\nRays of the sun lit the waters of the lake, and the vapours began to fade. The Lady of the Lake melted back into the water and disappeared. The other dukes turned and looked at Gilles bearing the banner of the Lady of the Lake. One stepped forward and said, “You bear her banner, you must lead us this day!” and immediately knelt and presented his sword to Gilles in the manner of a Knight Errant to a true Knight. Then the other dukes and Knights did likewise, acknowledging Gilles as their leader for this battle.\\n\\nThen the din of the approaching enemy was heard from all sides, fouling the air with their war cries and drumming. The Knights hurriedly took up their weapons and mounted their warhorses. They gathered in a battle line around Gilles and the banner.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_leader_battles_description	The Orc horde darkened the horizon ahead of the Bretonnian Knights. Steadily and without flinching they rode on as the arrows dropped around them. Then the moment came to charge, and the Knights plunged into the midst of the Orc horde. The first ranks of the enemy crumbled before them. The entire horde reeled like some great beast pierced by the hunter’s lance. The Knights cleaved through wave after wave of enemy and burst forth into the open plain beyond. All around them the enemy began to scatter in flight.\\n\\nAs the sun began to set, the Knights ceased their pursuit and rode back to the sacred lake. Here they gathered once more and rested as the rooks and ravens descended to feast on the Orcish slain. All the dukes and Knights gathered around Gilles and together they vowed to serve and honour the Lady of the Lake.\\n\\nThey also vowed to stay together as an army and free Bretonnia from the Orcs and all her other foes. Gilles was proclaimed ‘Leader of Battles’, with the authority to command the army and the entire resources of all the dukedoms until Bretonnia was freed. This moment marked the origin of the Grail Knights and also the Kingdom of Bretonnia.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, under the banner of the Lady of the Lake, Gilles led the Grail Knights from victory to victory throughout the length and breadth of Bretonnia. One by one the dukedoms of Bretonnia were freed from rampaging Orcs and other enemies. Settra’s raiders and the hordes of Chaos were flung back into the sea in two great battles fought on the sea shores. Wherever the army appeared, Knights who had been desperately besieged in remote and isolated castles joined Gilles. In every village, new Knights Errant were created and swelled the army.\\n\\nGilles led the Knights of Bretonnia in twelve great battles, and every one was a victory. At this time, Gilles became known as ‘Le Breton’, a title acknowledging his uncrowned authority throughout Bretonnia. The Orcs and Goblins were driven from the valleys and plains of Bretonnia and pushed into the mountains and forests.\\n\\nAccording to legend, it is said that after the tenth battle fought on the edges of the great forest of Athel Loren, Gilles encountered Elves from deep within the wood who had also been fighting the Orcs. Gilles and the Elven chiefs exchanged gifts of magical weapons and promised everlasting friendship.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_passing_giles_le_breton_description	Vast Orc and Goblin enclaves still persisted in the wilderness regions of Bretonnia, and there were many Orc warlords in hiding with the remnants of their tribes and vengeance in their hearts. One day, Gilles was riding with a small retinue of Knights Errant on pilgrimage to the sacred lake where the Lady of the Lake had appeared many years before. Suddenly the party was ambushed by Orcs led by a chieftain intent on revenge.\\n\\nThough outnumbered, Gilles and the Knights fought ferociously and slew every one of the Orcs. Many of the Knights Errant had been slain, only two and Gilles remained alive, but Gilles was mortally wounded by an evil enchanted weapon wielded by the vengeful Orc warlord, whose name history has rightfully thought fit to forget. Gilles’ companions took him down to the edge of the lake, hoping perhaps that the waters might be enchanted once again and Gilles might be saved. They began calling for the Lady of the Lake.\\n\\nAs they rested there in the fading evening sun, a swirling mist began to rise from the lake. Soon the carved prow of a boat could be seen emerging from the mist. It moved as if by enchantment, since it had no oars or sail. In the boat was the lone figure of a lady, but it was not the Lady of the Lake.\\n\\nThe Knights asked who she was and were told that she was the servant of the Lady of the Lake. Indeed this lady was the Fay Enchantress of Bretonnia, who lived a hermit-like existence in a cave on an island in the middle of the lake, seldom ever seen from the shore because of the mist.\\n\\nThe Enchantress asked the Knights to lay Gilles in the boat so she could take him to her island where he would be healed. She warned them that if she granted them this favour, the king could never return home, but must stay forever as the guardian of this sacred place, serving the Lady of the Lake as she did.\\n\\nThe Knights were reluctant to part with Gilles, but knew it must be so. Gilles bade farewell to his Knights and accepted his destiny. With heavy hearts, the Knights watched the boat carrying Gilles and the Enchantress glide into the mist and disappear.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_founding_kingdom_description	In the long distant past, the lands of the Bretonni were secured by Gilles le Breton, and the Kingdom of Bretonnia was formed. Each of the Bretonni lords swore oaths of fealty to Gilles, who they proclaimed as their ruler. The lords themselves were each given the title of duke, and the traditional borders of their lands were formalised, creating the fourteen dukedoms. Gilles became the ruler of all Bretonnia, though he also fulfilled the role of Duke of Bastonne.\\n\\nWith the tragic death of Gilles in the year 17 (995 by the Imperial Calendar), there was much lamentation throughout the lands as all of Bretonnia mourned. Gilles’ only son, Louis, who was born under mysterious circumstances – some say he was the child of the Lady herself –became the Duke of Bastonne. However, the question of whether he should also become ruler of Bretonnia was much debated.\\n\\nMany advocated that Landuin of Mousillon should take the position, while others believed that Landuin’s rival, Thierulf of Lyonesse, or the wise Marcus of Bordeleaux, would make a more suitable ruler. The majority of the dukes eventually agreed that Louis should take the role, but that posed another problem, for he had not drunk from the Grail of the Lady of the Lake, as had all the other dukes. And no knight, it was decreed, no matter his birth, should be able to become Lord of Bretonnia without first having the blessing of the goddess.\\n\\nSo it was that Louis left court and set out immediately on his quest to find the Lady and prove his worth before her, earning himself the title ‘the Rash’. Thus was the tradition of the Questing Knight born. For years Louis the Rash travelled the length and breadth of Bretonnia, righting wrongs and doing great deeds. In his absence, Thierulf of Lyonesse acted as steward of Bretonnia, much to the chagrin of Mousillon, so it is said.\\n\\nYears later, Louis entered his ancestral castle astride a mighty purebred charger, his golden hair shining and his eyes aglow with noble power. None could doubt that the lady had blessed him, and his subjects fell to their knees before him. So it was that he was crowned as King of Bretonnia, and the golden Crown of Bretonnia, a gift from the Lady herself, was placed upon his brow by the Fay Enchantress, she who had borne away the fatally wounded Gilles and who was the sacred representative of the Lady of the Lake herself. All of Bretonnia rejoiced in their new monarch.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_birth_chivalry_description	Louis the Rash’s first act as king was to formalise the code of honour that his father and the Companions lived by. The original vows of chivalric knighthood still exist within the halls of Bastonne, crumbling parchments decorated with elaborate script that detail the duties of the knights. All over Bretonnia, the knights embraced their vows, and many noble warriors gave up their castles to embark on the path of the Questing Knight.\\n\\nA wave of faith swept Bretonnia, and the Lady of the Lake became the primary deity of the nobles. The dukes continued to push back evil from their borders, and Bretonnia flourished. The great port cities grew large and sprawling with renewed trade, Grail chapels were built in places of holy significance, and the Fay Enchantress guided the Bretonnians in the worship of the Lady.\\n\\nFor hundreds of years, Bretonnia continued to grow in strength and influence. When their lands were threatened, they crushed their foes – for who indeed could hope to best the might of a unified Bretonnia? Even as the last of the Grail Companions passed from this world and were mourned, ever more knights succeeded in their own quest for the Grail, and the otherworldly Grail Knights became a great power within the dukedoms.\\n\\nMany great battles were won, and sumptuous victory banquets were common. King Guillaume defeated the Orc tribes of the Massif Orcal highlands, sparing none. Lord Lamorte smashed the fleets of the Undead at Savage Point. The hated beasts of the forest were pushed deeper into their darkened realms, expelled from the open lands by Duke Theodremund of Artois. With Bretonnia itself strong and secure, the dukes turned their gaze beyond their traditional borders.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_the_crusades_description	In the year 470 (1448 by the Imperial Calendar), the southern realm of Estalia was invaded by Jaffar, the hated despot of Araby. Diplomatic envoys pleaded with Bretonnia to send aid, and the king sent out his call to war. Throughout all the dukedoms this call was heard, and countless knights pledged their lance to the cause.\\n\\nIn his noble wisdom, King Louis the Righteous gave permission for warriors of the Empire to cross into Bretonnia on their journey to Estalia, for they too had pledged their aid, despite the lack of honour that the Empire had oft displayed.\\n\\nThe innumerable armies of Jaffar could not stand before the might of Bretonnia, and thousands fell beneath the charge of the noble knights. Retreating back to Araby, Jaffar’s armies were hounded by the Bretonnians, who pursued them tirelessly.\\n\\nNot even the harsh desert conditions could perturb the knights, and their fervour slowly took its toll on Jaffar’s warriors. As the wars entered their third year, Jaffar’s armies began to fracture, for many of the tribes grew weary of the despot’s tyranny. After frustrating months of minor skirmishes, the Bretonnians faced Jaffar at the Battle of El Haikk.\\n\\nElemental spirits of the deep desert were summoned to fight alongside Jaffar’s armies, yet, despite being vastly outnumbered, a great victory was won by the Bretonnians, and the despot’s forces scattered. Disliking the harsh, dry land, for it proved too vast and hostile to be properly conquered, the Bretonnians sailed back home, their cargo holds filled with exotic treasure and spoils.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a second great crusading army, led by Baron Tybalt, had left Bretonnia and was travelling the long road overland towards Araby. Hearing of the great victory, this force did not press on to the desert lands, though many of the knights smarted not to have shared in the glory, and a great many of them wished to enter the lands of the hated desert kings.\\n\\nNevertheless, under Tybalt’s leadership, they pushed into lands that had not yet been conquered by any civilised race. Seeking glory and honour, they sought out the armies of Greenskins that plagued these lands, and many great victories followed.\\n\\nThe hardy Dwarfs that dwelled in the mountains around these lands rejoiced, for the Bretonnians had dealt a serious blow to their ancient enemies, the Orcs, and they bestowed much praise and honour upon the knights. Rare it was these days for the reclusive Dwarfs to have contact with the world outside their mountain holds, yet this victory ensured that a bond was formed between the two civilisations.\\n\\nThese lands later became known as the Border Princes. Indeed, some knights remained there, building great castles in the following decades.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_errantry_wars_description	Despite grand crusades beyond Bretonnia, the dukedoms themselves were not left undefended, for there were still intermittent threats within the borders. One such threat coincided with the deadly Red Pox that swept through the southern dukedoms, decimating the populations of peasants in the stinking slums and hovel villages.\\n\\nAs if this were a trigger, foul creatures erupted from their hidden lairs, mutated vermin that walked like men and held rusting weapons in their clawed hands. Marching to the aid of the Duke of Parravon came the mysterious fey folk of Athel Loren, lending their otherworldly powers to the knights to destroy this threat before disappearing once more.\\n\\nOther perils have all been successfully defeated, including attacks from other hated minions of Chaos, be they berserk Norsemen or foul forest beasts.\\n\\nThroughout the ages, other crusades have been waged by the proud Bretonnians, though none so great. One such crusade was led into the deep deserts to the east of Araby, and a great many battles were fought against the hated Undead kings of that land. Others have seen Bretonnians fighting far from home, even as far across the oceans as the jungle lands of the New World.\\n\\nSome of these crusades were declared as Errantry Wars, a tradition that derives from the old custom of the Errand of Knighthood. Usually young knights would be set a task by their lord, an errand that they must fulfil before they can attain full knighthood. Errands traditionally included such things as the recovery of a lost artefact, the slaying of a beast terrorising a rural village or successfully escorting a noble lady through dangerous lands.\\n\\nHowever, in times of war and peril, a king may declare an Errantry War. At such time, a young Knight Errant may earn the title of Knight of the Realm through brave deeds and dating exploits on the field of battle. When an Errantry War is declared, young knights from all over Bretonnia rally to the cause, eager to earn their full knighthood. The unseasoned knights throw themselves into battle recklessly and with great enthusiasm, each trying to outdo the others, and gain the attention of their betters. As such, the king may declare an Errantry War when he has a need to quickly gather a large, well-motivated army.\\n\\nIn the year 1223 (2201 by the Imperial Calendar), King Louen Orc-Slayer amassed a grand army after declaring an Errantry War, with thousands of young knights joining the ranks of the more experienced retinues of the dukes. Together, this army smashed the growing Orc and Goblin forces that had been amassing for many years on the borders of Bretonnia.\\n\\nThe traditional frontiers of the dukedoms were expanded, and many Greenskin strongholds, which had remained in isolated areas along the borders, were finally conquered. New castles were built along these borders, and many of the young Knights Errant were granted these domains along with full knightly title at the end of the years of war.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_castle_air_description	The longest Errantry War ever fought was launched by King Charlen in 1442 (2420 by the Imperial Calendar). The Border Princes were overrun by enemies and, despite their bitter resistance, they were being worn down. Charlen responded instantly to their appeal for aid, declaring his intention to rid the Old World of the Greenskin menace once and for all. Charlen was a brave and mighty warrior, but was never known for his great powers of wit or learning, for scholars knew that the Greenskin hordes could never truly be eradicated.\\n\\nNevertheless, countless thousands of young knights embraced Charlen’s vision passionately, and a great army set off across the mountains. However, a great many knights perished on this arduous journey.\\n\\nAt first, victory followed victory, and the Orcs were slaughtered on the banks of Blood River. Nevertheless, as the years rolled by and more young knights travelled to the region to gain honour, Bretonnia grew weaker due to the lack of defenders within its borders. For over sixty years, the wars continued, draining Bretonnia of entire generations of knights.\\n\\nEventually, under King Phillippe V, the Errantry War was ended after a tragic defeat at Dread Pass. The Bretonnians, in their pride, do not cope well with defeat, and were it not for the wise king ending the wars, then countless more knights may well have thrown their lives away in an effort to regain the honour of their defeated brethren.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_dead_walk_lands_description	The dead rising from their graves is a common theme amongst the troupes of travelling players that journey around Bretonnia, reflecting the profound effect that the Undead have had on the nation. A very superstitious people, the idea of the dead walking is especially horrific and abhorrent to the Bretonnians, both noble and commoner alike.\\n\\nPeasants will often bury their loved ones face down in the earth, with dried crows’ feet in their mouths and cloves of garlic in their ears, apparently to stop them from rising from their graves. In times long past, legions of dead warriors borne upon the seas in fleets of shallow-bottomed boats raided the coastline, and rumours of these fleets still persist.\\n\\nIn isolated hamlets across Bretonnia there are said to be foul vampiric warrior-knights, the most famous of these being the so-called Red Duke who plagued the lands of Aquitaine. Many a Questing Knight has set out to rid the lands of these horrors, and never returned.\\n\\nThe cursed realm of Mousillon has long been associated with the dead. Indeed it is a very morbid realm, for death and disaster feature strongly in its history. Being built on a sinking swampland, and subject to frequent flooding, the tombs of the dead in Mousillon are built above ground – so large are the sprawling, macabre graveyards that they are likened to towns in their own right. It is said that all manner of foul necromantic sorcerers lurk amidst the darkened crypts.\\n\\nOne of the more recent, major battles fought against the Undead took place at la Maisontaal Abbey, in the Grey Mountains. An Undead horde, led by the dread Lichemaster Heinrich Kemmler and a dead warrior of Chaos, Krell, attacked this sacred place.\\n\\nThe Lichemaster is a hated figure in Bretonnian lore, and mothers use stories of his deeds to scare their children into behaving. The battle was only won thanks to the skill and heroism of Duke Tancred of Quenelles and his knights, even though they were also assailed by a swarm of foul Chaotic vermin.\\n\\nThe knights returned to their lands with much honour, for their victory truly valorous. Nevertheless, the Lichemaster escaped from the battle, and Tancred spent the remainder of his life pursuing the hated necromancer. Tragically, Tancred himself fell in battle with the forces of the Lichemaster at the Battle of Montfort Bridge, though he did succeed in smashing Kemmler’s force. It is said that the Lichemaster is biding his time to exact his revenge against Bretonnia.\\n	false

gen_lore_brt_land_despair_description	Mousillon is a cursed realm, a crumbling city surrounded by stinking swamps and marshes, a land that is shunned by the rest of Bretonnia. It is said that in that doom-laden land the dead walk the dark and empty streets, that all manner of unnamed horrors lurk in the depths below the castles, and that the night is filled with screams and laughter from beings no longer of this earth.\\n\\nThose dwelling there are the most desperate of people, for none would choose to live in this tragic land other than the evil-hearted and the outcast. Dispossessed and dishonoured knights band together here, as do hordes of the most malformed and diseased peasants. Those few who remain of the cursed bloodline of Mousillon rule this land with absolute authority. These remnants of the decadent and corrupt nobility wear pitch-black armour, and never raise their visors, or so it is said I n fireside tales.\\n\\nHowever, for a period in history, Mousillon threw off its dark reputation. This was during the time of Gilles le Breton and his Grail Companions; for the bravest, most skilled and honourable Companion of all was Landuin, the favoured son of Mousillon and their first duke. He was the epitome of knighthood, the paragon that all knights aspired towards, and he was beloved by all. None could stand before his wrath, and Mousillon gained much honour thanks to his mighty deeds.\\n\\nTragically, with the death of Gilles, Landuin fell into a terrible malaise from which he never truly recovered. The land of Mousillon itself felt his pain and began to fall into ruin and despair, continuing to do so even after his death. Thus did Mousillon begin to fall back towards being a realm shunned by the other Bretonnian dukedoms. It has since fallen farther into darkness. Many believe that the land itself is cursed – it is certainly true that vermin seem to thrive in this foetid land, that many dwelling within its borders suffer madness, and many other unnatural things occur on an almost daily basis.\\n\\nTwo key moments in history can be isolated that have irredeemably doomed this haunted land in the eyes of the other dukedoms. The first of these occurred during the outbreak of the terrible Red Pox, in the early years of the ninth century, after the formation of Bretonnia. The Duke of Mousillon, Merovech, was a proud warrior who was desperate for his realm to regain the prestige and honour that it had during the reign of Landuin. Led astray by his corrupted advisors, but with only honourable intentions, Merovech began dabbling in things far beyond his power or control.\\n\\nWhen the Red Pox struck Bretonnia in 835 (1813 by the Imperial Calendar), Merovech and his knights were strangely unaffected. As foul rat-creatures appeared in their thousands to kill and maim, Merovech saw that his time to shine had come. Riding south with his black-armoured knights, he slew thousands of the Chaotic creatures and broke the siege of Brionne. The route his army took mirrored that road taken by Gilles’ Grail Companions before him, as he then pushed towards the east, crossing Carcassonne. His dreams were filled with blood, death and horror – in his delusions, he actually believed that he was Landuin reborn, and that he was the only one who could save Bretonnia.\\n\\nMeeting up with the armies of Parravon and the fey folk of Athel Loren, a great victory was won, and the rat-creatures scattered before the martial might of Merovech and his most trusted knights. In the middle of the battle, Merovech was soaked in blood, revelling in the killing. Even after his foe lay unmoving, still he continued to hack at them with his gore-soaked blade. The virtuous and honourable knights of Parravon looked on in horror.\\n	false

Many saw him as a saviour, for he had saved Brionne and Quenelles. Nevertheless, the banquet horrified the chivalrous dukes. Dinner was served by shambling servants, and the dukes were shocked to see spitted and impaled criminals arrayed about the hall.\\n\\nMerovech could not understand their discomfort at all, and having already drained many goblets of fine Bordeleaux wine, he drunkenly claimed that his hospitality was being dishonoured. The king was repulsed by Merovech, and spoke against him and his court. In a rage, Merovech accused the king of jealousy and of plotting against Mousillon.\\n\\nThe king formally challenged Merovech, though the other dukes begged to be the one allowed to punish the disgraceful knight. In the ensuing combat, Merovech fought like a daemon and tore out the king’s throat with his bare hands. Merovech raised his goblet and filled it with the blood of the king, which he then drank from. The other dukes hastily left Mousillon to gather their armies, pursued by twisted creatures and malformed peasants.\\n\\nIn the following months, Merovech was publicly denounced by the Fay Enchantress and the newly crowned king. Lyonesse led a massive invasion of Mousillon, and many of the knights of Mousillon gladly took up arms against their liege-lord, having no wish to be associated with their corrupted duke, and swore fealty to Lyonesse. Faced with the might of all of Bretonnia, Merovech was finally slain, though many brave warriors fell beneath his blade. The righteous anger of the Bretonnians against one they saw as having tainted their own honour was truly to be feared.\\n\\nLater, Mousillon fell even further during the Affair of the False Grail – a terrible time when Duke Maldred of Mousillon perpetrated the vilest of crimes. He conspired through treachery to become king, imprisoned the Fay Enchantress and falsely claimed to have recovered the Grail, though this was later proved another of his subtle lies created to gain power.\\n\\nHis actions doomed himself and finally condemned his homeland utterly, and he eventually died after a prolonged siege. From that moment forth, Mousillon was to have no duke, by order of the king, and so the position remains unfilled. In recent years however, there have been stories of a new claimant, a self-appointed duke.\\n\\nIt is said that King Louen may soon embark upon another war to cleanse Mousillon of its growing taint. The Bretonnians as a whole look forward to the day when Mousillon is finally razed, burnt to the ground and forgotten by history.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_origin_vampires_description	Vampires are immortal beings that have spread the curse of undeath across the lands for thousands of years. Though almost all of them now dwell in the rain-swept forests of the north, their origins lie in the sun-baked desert cities of the Land of the Dead.\\n\\nSouth of the Empire, south of the Border Princes, south even of the Badlands and Karak Azul, lies a land of which very little is known. Even those who know its true name – Nehekhara – do not say the word aloud. They refer to it in hushed tones as the Land of the Dead. Few men have been there and returned to tell the tale, and so the history of the Land of the Dead is steeped in black rumour and shrouded in mystery. A few insights can be gleaned from ancient texts, such as Abdul ben Raschid’s Book of the Dead.\\n\\nThis great tome tells of how the powerful Priest King, Settra, conquered all of the cities of the realm of Nehekhara, and yet he was not content, for he could not defeat death. He set his priests to solving the mystery of immortality, and though they extended his life for many years, they could not unlock the secrets of eternal life.\\n\\nFollowing Settra’s death and entombment within a vast pyramid, successive Priest Kings became similarly obsessed with avoiding death. Over time, the great mortuary temples and pyramids dwarfed the cities of the living, and all thought and endeavour was bent towards immortal life. Eventually, this obsession with achieving immortality would bring about Nehekhara’s demise and, from its death throes, the birth of the Vampires.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_rise_nagash_description	Roughly four-and-a-half thousand years before the present day, Nagash was born in Khemri, largest of the cities of Nehekhara. The brother of the reigning Priest King, Nagash was a mighty priest well-versed in the mystical incantations of his folk. From an early age, Nagash was obsessed with death, even more so than the rest of his people.\\n\\nNagash wandered through the city’s necropolis for weeks at a time, and entered the oldest tombs without fear. He observed the morticians as they prepared the dead for internment. He watched warriors wounded in battle fade and die, and resolved that he would never succumb to such a fate.\\n\\nIt was Nagash’s capture, and subsequent torture, of a small party of shipwrecked Dark Elves that led to his discovery of Dark Magic. Nagash soon mastered the basics of necromancy, and the people of the city began to shun him. A natural and brilliant sorcerer, his experiments met with considerable success.\\n\\nAmongst the greatest of his macabre achievements was the distillation of an elixir from human blood that would grant everlasting life to its drinker. Soon, Nagash had a loyal following of noblemen with whom he shared his discovery. In a bloody coup, Nagash seized control of Khemri and had his brother buried alive within their father’s pyramid.\\n\\nAs the years turned into decades and the decades turned to centuries, Nagash and his followers took to conducting their experiments and rituals hidden in the cool, dark places in the palatial tombs of the necropolis. They began to shun the light altogether as they made plans for their dark ascension.\\n\\nNagash supervised the building of a great Black Pyramid, one of the mightiest structures ever attempted by man. It cost a great many lives to build, but the blood, sweat and souls given to its construction only increased its potency, for the pyramid was designed to attract the foul winds of Dark Magic. For the Priest Kings of the other cities, long disturbed by events in Khemri, this was the final blasphemy. They formed an alliance against Nagash and sent their armies into battle with him.\\n\\nDuring the long war that followed, waves of dark power blasted the lands. Many of Nehekhara’s oases were so saturated that they became as dismal and lifeless as the surrounding desert. After nearly a century of constant warfare, however, the armies of the Priest Kings succeeded in sacking Khemri.\\n\\nAs Nagash fled from the burning city into the cold depths of his pyramid, the Great Necromancer swore to the Priest Kings that their cities would become as dust. The Priest Kings laughed. One by one they found Nagash’s disciples within the pyramid and dragged them out screaming to be burned and beheaded in the sunlight.\\n\\nAll of the morbid statues and monuments to Nagash’s glory were toppled into the sand. The sanctums of the Necromancer’s disciples were despoiled, and the practice of Dark Magic was outlawed on pain of death. Yet the agents of the Priest Kings could not find the renegade himself. Although his disciples claimed to have seen Nagash enter his sarcophagus, the coffin itself was mysteriously empty.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_damnation_lahmia_description	In defiance of the laws imposed by the Priest Kings, Neferata, the Queen of Lahmia, stole the most potent of Nagash’s books and pursued her own studies in the dark arts. She attempted to replicate the Elixir of Life, and eventually she had a small measure of success.\\n\\nNeferata no longer seemed to age, but was possessed of a terrible thirst for blood. Over time, many of the court of Neferata also drank the elixir, and joined her as Vampire lords and ladies. Thus was the dynasty of the Lahmian Vampires born into the world.\\n\\nMore cautious than Nagash, they took pains to conceal their nature from the other Priest Kings. The first Vampires reigned like gods over Lahmia, governed by their undying queen and hidden from the ire of the Priest Kings.\\n\\nGradually, the Vampire covens of Lahmia began to grow in confidence, and their excesses increased. They would not submit to walk the earth like common soldiers, and insisted upon being borne upon ornate thrones at all times. Hundreds of slaves entered their palaces every day, and were never seen again.\\n\\nThese Vampires also learned that Nagash had not been destroyed, but was rebuilding his power in the citadel of Cripple Peak, which would become known as Nagashizzar. In thrall to the Great Necromancer and bound to him by the corrupted Elixir of Life, the rulers of Lahmia sent envoys to Cripple Peak. Agents of the Priest Kings captured and interrogated some of these heralds, and the Vampires’ existence was uncovered.\\n\\nEnraged beyond measure, the Priest Kings once more amassed their armies and made war. The fight for Lahmia was long and bloody, with the deadly Vampires using their strength and sorcerous skills to slay hundreds of the Priest Kings’ warriors.\\n\\nYet the Priest Kings were not without magic of their own, and their armies numbered in the tens of thousands. Eventually, the Vampires lost the battle. The population of Lahmia was enslaved, the pyramids smashed, and the Vampires driven out. Most fled northward, one-by-one arriving in Nagashizzar to be welcomed by the Great Necromancer. Nagash looked upon the corrupt immortals and was pleased. The Vampires were worthy champions for his armies, their damnation a tribute to his dark genius.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_war_priest_kings_description	Nagash had not been idle and had learned much about the art of necromancy and animating the dead, conceiving of a mad and deadly master plan. He vowed to turn the entire world into a necropolis filled only by the unquiet dead, where no action would be performed, no deed done, save when he willed it. Nagash would be the lord over all of it.\\n\\nThe first step on Nagash’s road to utter dominion was the elimination of his former homeland, for he wished a bitter vengeance upon the Priest Kings. At his command, the Vampires led his legions forth to war. On ships made of fused bone, the Undead horde made its way from the Sour Sea, down what future generations would know as the Straits of Nagash, to the Bitter Sea. The Undead legions made landfall at the ruined port of Lahmia and surged forwards on their mortal foes, the exiled Vampires spearheading the attack.\\n\\nHowever, Nagash had seriously underestimated his former countrymen. In the time of his absence, the Land of the Great Vitae River had become a mighty empire ruled by a single Priest King – Alcadizaar the Conqueror. Alcadizaar was the greatest general of his age and his empire was at the zenith of its power. When the Undead came, they found themselves opposed by a unified, confident army. Moreover, the enchanters of the Great Kingdom had made progress in the arts of magic, particularly in the creation of animated war-constructs. No easy victory was possible against them.\\n\\nThe ensuing wars stained the sands red for many years. The Vampires were mighty sorcerers and fell warriors, and they were determined to reclaim their kingdom. Wherever they appeared, terror and dread came upon the enemy, yet the Vampires were not invincible. The war swayed backwards and forwards for a decade. At first, the legions of the Undead had the upper hand, then the armies of Alcadizaar struck back with displays of tactical genius. Battle after battle was fought until all of Nagash’s legions were destroyed. The defeated Vampires fled across the desert to Nagashizzar to bring their dark master the report of their failure.\\n\\nGreat was Nagash’s rage. He cursed the vampiric captains that had failed him. Ever afterward they would know constant pain and their howling cries would carry the knowledge of their misery to all men. The remaining Vampires fled Nagashizzar by night, dispersing in all directions to confuse pursuit. Even after Nagash’s death at the hands of Alcadizaar, the Vampires bore his curse. Thus, the first Vampires disappeared across the world, each founding their own bloodthirsty dynasty that would endure and grow through the centuries, terrorising the living to the present day.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_nature_dark_magic_subtitle	On The Nature Of Dark Magic	false
gen_lore_vmp_nature_dark_magic_description	To understand the nature of Necromancy, one must first understand that of Dark Magic. Gales of magical force spew from the ruined gateway of the far north, and most of these divide into the eight Winds of Magic as they gust and disperse across the globe. These are the etheric forces channelled and wielded as spells by the Battle Wizards of the Empire.\\n\\nSome of these forces, however, remain as Dark Magic, pooling and eddying in places of great emotional disturbance. The greatest concentration of Dark Magic gathers at mass graves, battlefields and plague-ridden settlements. Even murder houses and abattoirs attract reservoirs of this invisible force, causing all manner of freakish disturbances and hauntings to manifest in the middle of the night.\\n\\nA peculiar quality of this occult energy is that like attracts like, and places of anguish and death eventually accrue so much Dark Magic that it crystallises into the evil greenish-black crystal known as warpstone. Warpstone is a substance craved by the power-hungry of all races, but by the Skaven above all.\\n\\nIt is a simple matter for a Vampire within such an unhallowed site to channel his innate power over Dark Magic, harnessing the vile energies that reside there, and raise the corpses, spirits and skeletons that lie beneath the loam to serve him. Only the Priests of the death-god Morr are able to put a departed spirit to an eternal rest beyond the reach of these pallid fiends.\\n	false

gen_lore_vmp_legions_beneath_description	It is the Stirlanders' way, when a good friend or close relative dies, to stuff the gullet of the corpse with garlic, crow’s feet, and sprigs of hawthorn and bloodwort. Copper coins are pressed hard into its eye sockets as offerings to Morr and the cadaver is buried face-down in a deep, dark grave. With the dead protected in this way, the necromantic fiends that plague the Old World are kept from harvesting their grisly crop.\\n\\nDespite these precautions, in darkest Sylvania, the walking dead are a far more common sight than road wardens or agents of the Imperial crown. The vampiric lords that lurk in the tumbledown castles of that land have had millennia to perfect their arts, and eternity teaches patience above all else.\\n\\nIn truth, raising the dead in Sylvania is a relatively simple business. The very land is saturated with Dark Magic, and for every corpse consecrated in the proper fashion, there are ten that stir uneasily in unmarked graves. Even a simple cantrip can cause the earth underfoot to shiver and moan.\\n\\nWhen Morrslieb hangs low, armies of long-dead corpses spontaneously claw their way to the surface and writhe out from the loam. Gathered by their masters into tightly packed mobs of dead flesh, they set upon the living, each horde led by the bloodthirsty kin of the first Vampires to stalk the world.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_coming_old_ones_description	The realm of the Celestial Dragon predates the coming of the Old Ones. Though little is known of such ancient times, what is known is that when the cold earth shuddered and lava flowed from restless volcanoes, when the smoke-blackened skies above were filled with soaring Dragons that battled for superiority amongst the mountain peaks, the Celestial Dragon ruled the great expanses of the eastern hemisphere unrivalled.\\n\\nWith the coming of the Old Ones and the warming of the world, Xen Yang, as the Celestial Dragon named himself, saw the power wielded by the servants of these godly beings from beyond the stars and, though others of his kind made war upon the interlopers, he chose to observe their strange industry.\\n\\nThrough this careful observation, Xen Yang learned to command the Winds of Magic unleashed upon his world from the towering gateways raised by the Old Ones. Over long centuries, he watched as the great beasts of his world retreated into the darkness, their dominion over the lands usurped by the young races of Elves, Dwarfs and Men.\\n\\nIt was at this time that the Celestial Dragon took for himself a mate in the form of Quai Yin, the Moon Dragon. Born of Yueyin (the moon called Mannslieb in the Old World), Quai Yin first adopted the form of a Dragon so that she might descend to the world and live beside Xen Yang, before sharing with him the secrets of her shapeshifting that both could take on human forms and walk freely amongst the tribes of Man that thrived in Grand Cathay.\\n	false

Gradually, the Celestial Dragon worked to unite the tribes of his realm, becoming a respected leader, though he resisted titles and refused their worship or adulation, preferring to spread enlightenment rather than wallow in praise.\\n\\nIn time, the pair welcomed nine Draconic children, teaching each of them the art of shapeshifting and the mastery of the Winds of Magic, and tempering their primal fury that they, too, may walk amongst Man. As these children grew, they aided their parents in the betterment of the people of Grand Cathay, teaching them ever more of the arts of civilisation and leading them in their exploration of other lands and their encounters with other races.\\n\\nYet despite the joy of Xen Yang and his family, and despite the prosperity of the folk of Grand Cathay, not all was well in the realm of the Celestial Dragon. From the north, where the great polar gates of the Old Ones hung, linking the mortal realm to the distant and unimaginable realms of these enigmatic beings, whispers crept unbidden into the Celestial Dragon’s dreams. At night, the faces of leering daemons haunted him, offering him power unimagined if he would but help them cross the barrier the Old Ones had first opened, then barred, between their realm, the æther, and his.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_the_cataclysm_description	The vast dimensional gates the Old Ones had erected at the world’s poles served as more than mere portals allowing almost instantaneous travel across the interstellar deeps, they were conduits through which raw magic flowed from an alternative dimension called the æther. This arcane energy drove the world-altering machineries of the Old Ones and gave power to their sorcerous servants. Indeed, it was this very power that the Celestial Dragon himself had studied and mastered.\\n\\nYet magic was not the only thing that dwelt within the æther. Great, predatory beings swam within its strange currents. Drawn to the warmth and light of the Old One’s gate, these vast entities hungered for the vitality of the world beyond. They probed at the portal, feeling around its edges for weaknesses and sending tendrils of their consciousness into the world beyond, their whispered voices intruding upon the dreams of mortals.\\n\\nIn time, the denizens of the æther grew strong and bold enough to break through the great portals of the Old Ones, shattering them and unleashing a cataclysmic torrent of chaos and destruction. In an instant, the heavens were rent asunder and hideous waves of raw chaos enveloped the world.\\n\\nAs the disaster unfolded, the Celestial Dragon wrestled with the uncontrollable magic that raged around him. Gradually, he bent the torrent of raw power to his will, stilling the storms and banishing from Grand Cathay the legions of daemons that rode upon them, scattering them to the far corners of the world.\\n\\nChaos had come to the world, and the Celestial Dragon knew instinctively that with it came an epoch of war.\\n	false

Yet despite their power, Xen Yang knew that he and his kin could not resist the evils arrayed against them alone. Thus the Celestial Dragon turned his attention towards the unification of the fractured tribes of Men that dwelt within his realm for, though they had long held him in high regard, the tribes of the north, south, east and west cared little for one another, preferring to make war than ally against greater threats.\\n\\nTo aid his plans, the Celestial Dragon dispatched several of his children to the far corners of his realm, tasking each with earning the loyalty and respect of the tribes that dwelt in their given lands and unifying them into a single nation under his rule. Thus did Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, travel north to live amongst the stalwart warriors of Nan-Gau, whilst Li Dao, the Fire Dragon, ventured south to unify the warlike tribes of the jungles of Chi’An and the towering Mountains of Heaven.\\n\\nTo the west went Zhao Ming, the Iron Dragon, tasked to share the Dragons’ wisdom with the alchemists of Shang Yang. To the east went Yin-Yin, the Sea Dragon, her heart filled with a thirst for adventure, she would lead the ship-builders and sailors of Fu-Chow in the conquest of the Jade Sea. Central Cathay was entrusted to Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon. From his palace in Wei-Jin, the pragmatic Yuan Bo would act as a voice of reason between people that had once been enemies and ensure the unity of the nascent Grand Cathay.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_empire_east_description	Grand Cathay is rightly counted amongst the largest and most prosperous of human nations in all the known world, a land of bustling cities, great expanses of fertile farmland and towering mountain ranges that reach towards the heavens above. But the size of its territory or number of citizens is not what sets it apart from its contemporaries. Rather, what distinguishes the empire of the Celestial Dragon from the nations of the Old World is the harmony and unity of its people and their masters, for where other nations are riven by strife born of the jealousy and greed of unworthy rulers, Grand Cathay knows no such turmoil or dissent.\\n\\nWhere other nations are blighted by internecine warfare, their people ever fearful and driven to jealously guard their meagre possessions and hoard what little temporal power they possess, Cathayans are not so mean of spirit. They are a people united in purpose, rightly proud of their great nation and its powerful rulers. Cathayans are ever diligent in their work, always considerate of the needs of their neighbours and elders, and safe in the certain knowledge that their masters are likewise ever mindful of their subjects’ contentment.\\n\\nSuch peace and harmony comes not from a cowed population, for the people of Grand Cathay are bold and courageous warriors and ever curious seekers of knowledge. No, the tranquillity enjoyed by the people of the Celestial Dragon’s eternal realm stems from the nature of its rulers, for Grand Cathay is an empire ruled by Dragons in more than name.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_ruled_dragons_description	To the Men of the west, the Dragons of Grand Cathay are powerful rulers of an ancient dynasty, beloved by their subjects and unassailable upon bejewelled thrones within gilded palaces. Yet the nations of the Old World seldom think deeply upon the nature of the Cathayan Dragons, considering their grand titles to be just that – titles granted to powerful rulers by loyal subjects.\\n\\nBut there is no hyperbole in the titles the Dragons of Grand Cathay wear, for they are immortal creatures of tremendous power who can trace their lineage back to the primeval origins of the world, before even the Old Ones descended from the stars. Greatest of these Dragons is Xen Yang, the Celestial Dragon Emperor, a being of immeasurable age who adopts the form of a human by choice to live amongst the people he rules. Together with his Empress, Quai Yin, the Moon Dragon, and their nine draconic children, the Celestial Dragon has ruled the east since before Men walked the lands now known as Grand Cathay.\\n\\nThese Dragons, and by extension their people, are creatures of order who seek balance in all things. Unlike those that would rule the Empire of the Old World, the Dragons’ desire for order and balance is not born of a need to tame the wilderness or achieve technological and economic dominance, but rather to be one with the world in which they exist. If other nations fight the currents of fate by swimming against them, the Dragons of Grand Cathay have learnt to move within those currents, turning their environment, the Winds of Magic, and even the will of their enemies to their advantage.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_folly_shiyama_description	With the people of Grand Cathay unified under his rule, the Celestial Dragon entrusted the command of his armies to Shiyama, the eldest and most beloved of his children. Long had Shiyama battled the evils of Chaos at her father’s side and, with vast armies of brave warriors at her command, she swore to rid the world of the daemonic legions that assailed it.\\n\\nYet for all her courage and ferocity, Shiyama’s pride was her weakness, and it was this pride that caused her to ignore her father’s warnings that Chaos could not be defeated by might alone. Instead, Shiyama mustered her armies and marched north, intent upon defeating the Ruinous Powers within their own twisted realm.\\n\\nSuch was Shiyama’s might, and so powerful was the sorcery she commanded, that her armies swept aside the daemonic legions that stood in her way, charging headlong towards the ruined border between the mortal world and the æther. Before her, Shiyama saw only the flight of Chaotic beasts and warped daemons, and she revelled in her victories, realising too late that she had been tricked by the gods of the æther.\\n\\nBy some foul sorcery the Ruinous Powers had befuddled the Dragon, making her believe her own bold soldiers were loathsome creatures of Chaos. It was not enemies that fled before her wrath but her own loyal warriors. It was not daemonic ichor that dripped from her talons, but the lifeblood of brave Cathayans.\\n\\nFilled with shame and horror, Shiyama turned tail and fled back to her father’s realm, driving her surviving warriors before her...\\n	false

They weaved powerful sorceries around the young Dragon and her warriors, making her appear to her kin as a terrible lord of the æther and giving the fleeing remnants of her once mighty army the appearance of capering daemons. Thus, as Shiyama neared the borders of her father’s realm, Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, believed a daemonic legion descended upon Nan-Gau from the Chaos Wastes, and she wasted no time in mustering her might to meet the threat.\\n\\nSensing the calamity unfolding on the border of his realm’s northern province, the Celestial Dragon raced to intervene, but for all his haste, Xen Yang could not hope to arrive in time. As he descended upon the accursed battlefield from the heavens, he witnessed the warriors of Nan-Gau closing upon the wounded Shiyama, and he saw first-hand the horror on the faces of his daughters as the ensorcellment of the Ruinous Powers faded and the Storm Dragon realised that the twisted daemon her soldiers had struck down was no enemy, but her own sister.\\n\\nAs the Celestial Dragon cradled the dying Shiyama in his arms, she begged forgiveness for her foolishness. Though he lacked the magic to restore her, Xen Yang used his great powers to bind his daughter’s spirit to Grand Cathay, and charged her with the task of protecting the ancestors of his people for as long as his realm endured. Thus did Shiyama come to rule the underworld in her father’s name, a mighty Spirit Dragon bound to Grand Cathay by the most potent of the Celestial Dragon’s sorceries.\\n	false

Concerned that rumours of Shiyama’s manipulation by the Ruinous Powers and her death at the hands of Cathayan soldiers would destabilise the nation and allow Chaos to fester, the Celestial Dragon turned to the Moon Dragon for counsel.\\n\\nThrough her grief, Quai Yin used her magic to obfuscate the memories of those that had witnessed Shiyama’s demise and spread the legend of the Spirit Dragon – though all would know of Shiyama as the guardian of the underworld, none in all Cathay would remember when she had walked amongst them in physical form.\\n\\nBut the Celestial Dragon’s heart still seethed with anger and regret. For centuries he had resisted the evil forces that battered his realm, protecting his family and his subjects alike, but he had always secretly known that his efforts were futile for the Ruinous Powers only grew stronger with each passing year. Now, with his firstborn daughter slain by the machinations of Chaos, Xen Yang knew that he had to act if he wanted to end the long war.\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Xen Yang as he set in motion plans to slay the great beasts of the æther that ruled the daemonic legions, similar plans were unfolding in distant lands. In far Ulthuan, a council of mages prepared a great ritual that would still the raging storms of magic. In Lustria, the Old Ones’ few remaining servants began a potent conjuration to banish the daemonic legions from the world. In the Worlds Edge Mountains, a living god undertook a quest to seal the shattered gates of the Old Ones.\\n	false

Battling hordes of daemons that coalesced from the magic-infused air about them, Xen Yang’s host advanced slowly through the hinterlands between reality and the æther until, eventually, the Realm of Chaos lay before them.\\n\\nSuddenly, a host of towering daemon lords descended from the tortured heavens to challenge the Dragons of Grand Cathay. Unperturbed, the Celestial Dragon and his children rose into the storm-wracked skies to meet the threat, revealing their true forms to the enemies arrayed against them. One by one the greatest and most powerful daemonic servants of the Ruinous Powers were laid low, fell lords of the æther that existed only to conquer worlds in the names of their evil masters were torn asunder by the fury of the Dragons, their foul essences banished back to the warped realm from which they came.\\n\\nThe ferocity of the Dragons and their mastery of the Winds of Magic proved too much for the daemons arrayed against them, and the Ruinous Powers were forced to commit ever more of their legions to the battle.\\n\\nThus did the heroism of the Cathayan Dragons in the face of Chaos converge with that of heroes in distant lands. With the subsiding of the Storms of Magic that had raged for more than a thousand years, the age of Chaos had ended, and a new age had begun.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_growth_prosperity_description	In the peace that followed the long war against Chaos, Grand Cathay prospered. Through his study of the Elemental Winds, the Celestial Dragon found that, by dividing the Elemental Winds into two distinct groups, Yang and Yin, he was able to teach the wisest of his subjects the secret arts of Feng Shi with an ease once undreamed of. Thus did he establish the Celestial Court within the city of Wei-Jin, a place where scholars could become mages and Astromancers through intense study of the world about them and the magical winds that blew through it.\\n\\nWhilst Xen Yang spent his days in contemplation of the world and its wonders, his children busied themselves with the governance of their provinces. As cities grew, technological advances happened quickly, aided by the Cathayans’ mastery of magic. Great stone sentinels were constructed to defend the realm from attackers, colossal warriors that stood as silent sentries until needed. Vast fleets of Sky Lanterns took to the heavens, covering tremendous distances in mere hours.\\n\\nElsewhere, Cathayan merchants and adventurers began to explore the world, traversing the great oceans by boat and the endless expanses of land between Grand Cathay and the western realms by wagon and horse. With the blessing of the Dragons that sent them, these travellers made contact with the Elves of Ulthuan, the Dwarfs of the Old World and the Men of ancient Nehekhara. Thus did Grand Cathay make treaties with other nations, grow wealthy from the mutually beneficial trading of goods and knowledge and, perhaps most importantly, grow secure through alliances forged against the evils that still lurked in the world.\\n\\nOver the centuries, Grand Cathay has fought many wars against Chaos, for the nation’s northern border is not protected from the ravages of the Marauder tribes by towering mountains or frozen seas, like those of the other nations of the Old World. For this reason, in -1800 IC, the Celestial Dragon commanded that a great wall be built along the length of the northern border.\\n\\nThe towering edifice that rose in response, a fortified bastion many hundreds of miles long, has endured for almost as long as the empire itself. The Great Bastion is a symbol of strength and defiance, and a testament to the power of the Celestial Dragon for, according to legend, when the wall was built, Xen Yang invested a measure of his magic in its stones.\\n	false

Through careful study of this arcane apparatus, the Celestial Dragon and the Astromancers of his court can easily ascertain whether the winds of Yang or Yin are in ascension and which are waning. Thus, they are able to direct the Winds of Magic, strengthening the Great Bastion with Yang magics and directing Yin magics along the Great River.\\n\\nTo further aid the nation’s defence, the artificers of Grand Cathay turned their ingenuity to the creation of many great machines of war, whilst alchemists worked to concoct a means to power them. To this end, the Cathayans discovered the secrets of black powder before even the Dwarfs of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Indeed, and though no Dwarf would admit it, black powder made in Grand Cathay is considered the finest in all the known world.\\n\\nWhilst such undertakings distinguish Grand Cathay from the nations of the Old World, it is the way in which the Celestial Dragon treats his subjects that is most noteworthy, for it exemplifies his personality. In many nations of Man, autocratic rulers keep their subjects at heel, impoverished and starved of opportunities for enlightenment or advancement, demanding their loyalty through tortuous military service and crippling labour, and demanding their wealth through heavy taxes.

gen_lore_cth_harmony_dragons_description	The Celestial Dragon and, by extension, his children, believe the purpose of a ruler is to act as a teacher, one who guides their people to find contentment in service and, through this service, to find their place in the natural order of things. Thus the folk of Grand Cathay serve not because they are compelled to do so out of fear or a lack of free will. They serve because, when faced with beings as wise, ancient and majestic as the Dragons, and when shown the belief those eternal rulers have in the wit, wisdom and goodness of spirit their subjects possess, how could those subjects do anything other than throw themselves completely into the service of their Emperor?\\n\\nThis philosophy is apparent in all things in Grand Cathay, including the way the nation wages war. Soldiers in the Celestial Dragon’s armies fight in ordered ranks, each trained to move in harmony with those around it, the entire army fighting like an extension of its general’s will. Harmony is also apparent in the wizards and war machines of Grand Cathay, the former able to combine their magics as a person might weave together threads of cloth, while the latter can unleash expertly timed bombardments and fusillades of gunfire undreamed of by enemy commanders.\\n\\nBut there are more ways in which the Celestial Dragon is unlike other Dragons of the mortal realm. Xen Yang does not slumber through the long ages as many Dragons do, preferring to remain an ever present ruler to his people, and growing more philosophical and introspective in the centuries since accepting the title of Emperor from his subjects.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_absent_emperor_description	Though in the early days of the empire, Xen Yang led many of Grand Cathay’s great undertakings, he has gradually given more control to his children, tasking Miao Ying, Yuan Bo, Yin-Yin, Li Dao and Zhao Ming with ever more responsibility, and entrusting the more secretive aspects of his nation’s governance to his mate, Quai Yin. With the governance of Grand Cathay in safe keeping, Xen Yang has taken to spending long periods in isolation within the Celestial Court.\\n\\nWhat he does there, none can say, though it is widely believed that he spends his days in contemplation of the world and its wonders, seeking some means by which to undo the harm done to his world by the coming of the Old Ones and the collapse of their polar gates. Indeed, if the Celestial Dragon could finally heal the great rift between this world and the æther, Chaos would be defeated and the world saved from its inevitable demise.\\n\\nIn the furtherance of his studies, it is not uncommon for the Celestial Dragon and the Moon Dragon to depart, disappearing into unknown realms for months, even years at a time. In 2000 IC, the pair departed Wei-Jin and left the running of the empire to their children. It was a time of darkness and disharmony for Cathay.\\n\\nThroughout the empire, rebel lords and ambitious magistrates schemed to take power, while the countryside became infested with bandit kings and criminals. The Jade Dragon struggled to hold the empire together, with little help from his bickering siblings. In the east, Yin-Yin, the Sea Dragon, departed with the Jade Fleet in search of gold and glory. \\n\\nAt the height of the crisis, the Monkey King claimed the Dragon Emperor’s throne and installed a Skaven Warlord as his advisor. Such ignominy finally caused the Dragon Children to end their infighting and face their common enemy and usurper of their father’s throne. The crisis finally ended when Xen Yang and Quai Yin returned, centuries after their mysterious absence, and drove the Monkey King from their lands.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_disdain_dragon_description	Since the earliest days of the world, the Celestial Dragon has been the undisputed ruler of his realm in the east. An apex predator that battled others of his kind for supremacy, he rose to power over the remains of younger and weaker Dragons. With the coming of the Old Ones, Xen Yang found himself increasingly alone, for many of his kind fell into oblivion, slain in battle with great saurian warhosts, whilst others drifted into deep slumbers as the world grew warm and the young races of Elves and Dwarfs emerged.\\n\\nTo protect himself in a changing world, the Celestial Dragon turned his focus inwards, mastering the magic of the Old Ones and learning to live amongst the humans that were thriving within his realm. Gradually, as the people of Cathay began to see him as a leader and protector, Xen Yang came to view himself as the guardian of the world’s eastern hemisphere, and he gladly left the custodianship of the west to the haughty, arrogant Elves and the stubborn, argumentative Dwarfs.\\n\\nWith great disgust, he looked on as the Elves of Ulthuan cowed the draconic children of his once mighty rivals to their service as beasts of burden. Impotently, he watched as the Dwarfs of the Worlds Edge Mountains slaughtered slumbering drakes of immense age in their lairs that they might plunder their treasures. Yet the humans of the west intrigued him as much as those of the east, and he observed with great interest as they took their first faltering steps upon the path to civilisation, emulating of their own volition the same great efforts made by his own subjects.\\n	false

To the west of Grand Cathay, tribes of Ogres roamed, their numbers increasing with each year. In time, they came to threaten the peace of the Celestial Dragon’s realm, and his armies marched regularly to battle the monstrous hosts.\\n\\nIn the mountains west of Grand Cathay, the realm of the Sky Titans came under constant attack from migrating Ogres. Sensing that the doom of a race that had walked the world since before the coming of the Old Ones was imminent, Xen Yang shared with them the secrets of black powder, enabling the Sky Titans to craft tremendous weapons of great power with which to battle their foes.\\n\\nYet such interventions proved futile and, with the Ogre Tribes growing ever bolder in their attacks upon Grand Cathay, the Celestial Dragon turned to his Astromancers to drive the invaders from his lands. To this end, a great meteorite of purest warpstone was pulled down from the heavens by the magic of the Celestial Court.\\n\\nWith the meteorite’s impact, thousands of miles of rolling tundra beyond Cathay’s western border were turned into an inhospitable wasteland, the very air turned deadly with warpstone dust. Where the meteorite struck, a colossal fang-filled maw opened within the earth, the waves of anguish and hunger emanating from it driving those Ogres not slain by the calamity westwards. Though the westernmost reaches of Cathay were preserved, the great migration of Ogres into the Mountains of Mourn was to prove the final doom of the Sky Titans.\\n	false

At first, the Cathayans turned to their Sky Lanterns as vessels of exploration, but quickly found them too small to bear the provisions needed to traverse the great expanses of ocean and wilderness beyond Cathay’s borders.\\n\\nWhilst his subjects turned their efforts to crafting ever larger and more durable craft to cross the heavens, Xen Yang tasked his youngest daughter, Yin-Yin, with dispatching her ocean fleets to explore the world’s seas and visit the distant nations of Man. The Sea Dragon, ever adventurous and inquisitive, eagerly obliged, often accompanying her agents on their voyages. Thus, agents of Grand Cathay landed on distant shores, offering greetings to those that dwelled there.\\n\\nElsewhere, the Western Master, Zhao Ming, explored the barren lands beyond his borders. Within the twisted and warped landscape of the Warpstone Desert, the Iron Dragon’s agents discovered unlimited alchemical treasures, treasures that were enthusiastically mined by the people of Shang Yang.\\n\\nTo facilitate such industry in such unfavourable climes, the Cathayans sought safe routes through the desert and crafted armoured wagons to which they bound protective charms. Through these endeavours, the agents of the Iron Dragon forged a permanent route through the narrowest part of the Warpstone Desert.\\n\\nThe Ivory Road, as this route came to be known, followed a twisting path through the desert. Marked by great carven stones, each ensorcelled by the mages of the Iron Dragon with powerful wards, the Ivory Road offered a route to the west which Zhao Ming explored as eagerly as Yin-Yin explored the vastness of the oceans.\\n	false

The first representatives of the Celestial Dragon to stand before the Priest Kings of Nehekhara arrived in Lahmia by boat from the east.\\n\\nThough the Nehekharans were suspicious of outsiders, tormented as they were by barbarous invaders from beyond their northern borders, they recognised in the Cathayans a sophisticated and civilised people and welcomed them to their grand palaces and into the hearts of their sprawling temple cities.\\n\\nEagerly, the Cathayans and Nehekharans began to trade, sharing arcane secrets and technological advances as readily as they shared precious metals and rare spices. To the Cathayans, the Nehekharans seemed superstitious, leading lives governed by the worship of a sprawling pantheon of gods, the adulation of which governed every aspect of their day to day lives.\\n\\nAmongst the priests of Nehekhara, tales of the immortal Celestial Dragon and his mighty dynasty proved captivating, and the devotees of Nehekhara’s Mortuary Cult devoted much to learning the secrets of Xen Yang’s power and longevity, secrets his representatives in far Nehekhara refused to be drawn on.\\n\\nYet, despite the secrets that remained between the two great nations, their alliance grew ever stronger, and the armies of Grand Cathay marched often beside the warriors of ancient Nehekhara, bringing war to the wild and desolate Darklands. From these joint campaigns into the monster infested wilderness, both nations prospered, Grand Cathay by opening up safer and more secure trade routes and increasing the steady flow of merchant caravans travelling east and west, Nehekhara by eagerly expanding its borders towards the distant horizon.\\n	false

When the Great Necromancer, Nagash, usurped the throne of Nehekhara, the realm swiftly fell into darkness under the heel of a brutal ruler.\\n\\nNagash was concerned only with advancing his sorcerous knowledge and prolonging his own life, and the extent of the evil magics he unleashed shocked the Celestial Dragon. Having long been suspicious of the motives of the Mortuary Cult, Xen Yang was suddenly presented with justification for his caution, and he quickly withdrew his representatives from the cities of Nehekhara and its many distant outposts.\\n\\nIn the centuries that followed, Xen Yang turned his attention towards strengthening his own realm. The Celestial Dragon wanted his empire to be self-sufficient, able to defend its own borders against the multitudinous threats arrayed against them rather than rely upon the fickleness of outsiders in times of need.\\n\\nTo this end, whilst war raged in Nehekhara and the many outposts of the Priest Kings’ empire fell to ruin, the people of Grand Cathay commenced work upon a vast, fortified wall upon their northernmost border, a Great Bastion of unimaginable length and impossible height, fortified along its entire length and bristling with the greatest weapons of war the Celestial Dragon could muster. This Great Bastion would defend the Celestial Dragon’s realm from the ever present threat of invasion from the north, where the Ruinous Powers gathered.\\n	false

He had seen a young and vibrant nation of Man wiped out by the evil of a single individual. He had witnessed magics of such vile potency unleashed that he, the Dragon that had slain the most terrible lords of the æther, knew a moment of fear at the thought of ever having to face Nagash upon the field of battle.\\n\\nWith his realm secure, Xen Yang began devoting ever more of his time to the study of the world and the mastery of magic. Retreating from the day to day concerns of his empire, he granted more power to his children to rule in his name, and for a brief time, Grand Cathay risked becoming insular and isolationist.\\n\\nYet despite the desire of the Celestial Dragon to focus only upon the needs of his empire, Grand Cathay’s thirst for travel and trade proved unquenchable. In the east, the fleets of the Sea Dragon continued to ply the oceans, trading more and more with the Elves of Ulthuan as Yin-Yin sought to increase diplomatic relations with such a powerful ally. Through her endeavours, the Sea Dragon ensured the fleets of Grand Cathay were free to sail the oceans far and wide, free from the scrutiny of the Elves.\\n\\nIn the west, the Iron Dragon continued his explorations of the hostile lands beyond his borders, making use of ever larger Sky Junks to cross the heavens and visit distant lands. Such explorations brought him into contact with the Dwarfs of the Worlds Edge Mountains, and both he and his sister Miao Ying, the Matriarch of Nan-Gau, eagerly traded technological and alchemical knowledge with the lords of the mountains.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_empire_west_description	Fifteen hundred years after the Time of Woe, when terrible earthquakes shook Grand Cathay, almost toppling the Great Bastion and heralding a Chaos incursion that almost overwhelmed the Celestial Dragon’s empire, the Dragons learned of a new empire rising in the distant west. A mighty barbarian chieftain named Sigmar Heldenhammer had succeeded in unifying the tribes of Men that dwelt beyond the Worlds Edge Mountains, in the heart of the Old World. Tales reached Xen Yang of Sigmar forming a powerful alliance with the Dwarfs and driving the Orc and Goblin tribes from his lands.\\n\\nImpressed and curious in equal measure, and sensing the significance of Sigmar’s reign, the Celestial Dragon dispatched no less an ambassador than his own daughter and the commander of his vast armies, Miao Ying, to the court of the Heldenhammer. The Storm Dragon travelled by ship to the west, pausing her journey amongst the Dragon’s Maw islands to exchange pleasantries with the Sea Lord of Ulthuan and learn more of the enigmatic barbarian chieftain who had unified the west. From there she dispatched messengers to the port of Marienburg to herald her coming, finally choosing to travel the last leg of her journey by Sky Lantern in order to make her arrival as momentous as possible.\\n\\nUpon meeting Sigmar, Miao Ying was taken aback. She had expected to meet a gruff and warlike barbarian, but was instead presented to an intelligent and eloquent king who wore his authority with an easy grace. Impressed, the Storm Dragon gladly extended her father’s friendship to the western Emperor, offering wealth and knowledge in exchange for trade. Sigmar, keen to make powerful allies, accepted the Celestial Dragon’s friendship, offering oaths of kinship to the eastern Emperor.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_harmony_east_west_description	Since that time, Sigmar’s Empire, and the many other nations of Man that have emerged around it to dominate the Old World, have built ever stronger bonds with Grand Cathay, trading goods, ideas and advancements freely. Driven by such commerce, migration between the Old World and Grand Cathay has become quite normal. Thus many of the Old World’s largest cities, great metropoles such as Marienburg, Magritta, Erengrad and Nuln, host substantial Cathayan quarters, populated by merchants, mercenaries, artisans and diplomats alike.\\n\\nSuch migration has led in turn to the reopening of great trade routes through the Darklands and across the northern steppes, routes that had gone untrodden since the demise of Nehekhara. Many are the adventurers and pioneers that have ventured into the wilderness, founding new outposts of humanity, such as Pigbarter on the banks of the River Ruin, rather than commit to long sea voyages. These fortified towns, rising from the ruins of ancient Nehekharan outposts, have become vital nodes in a vast network of roads connecting east and west.\\n\\nWhilst great armoured caravans brave the hostile expanses of the Warpstone Desert and fleets of Sky Junks drift across the steppes of Kislev bearing exotic goods to and from distant corners of the world, the Dragons of Grand Cathay themselves have also become visitors to the courts of the Old World.\\n\\nIndeed, ever since the first meeting between Miao Ying and Sigmar, the Dragons have had occasion to venture westwards in the company of grand armies. The visits of the Dragons to western nations often herald great upheaval, times when they arrive at moments of crisis to offer decisive support. Thus have the armies of the Celestial Dragon fought to defend the west many times, for though Xen Yang claims to view the custodianship of the west as a matter for the Elves and Dwarfs, his fondness for the Human nations of the Old World compels him and his children to intervene in times of direst need.\\n	false

gen_lore_cth_great_bastion_description	In the north, Miao Ying, the Storm Dragon, favoured daughter of her father, defends the Great Bastion that protects Grand Cathay from the open steppes and the Chaos Wastes beyond. A feat of almost unimaginable engineering, the Great Bastion climbs hundreds of feet above the landscape, its walls and towers bristling with cannon, archers and legions of soldiers. Such is the might of the Great Bastion that it has never fallen, and has only been breached a few times in its long history – often as the result of magic or cataclysmic seismic events.\\n\\nThe secret of its strength comes from its construction. Thousands of years ago, when the people of the Old World were little more than primitive warring tribes, the Celestial Dragon was fighting to preserve his domain from endless Chaos invasions. He foresaw the destruction of his empire at the hands of the Dark Gods and knew that, in time, even he would not be able to resist the rising tide of invaders.\\n\\nHis solution was to gather his greatest engineers and levy thousands upon thousands of his subjects to raise a wall from the mountains in the west to the ocean in the east, a barrier to stand for all time. As the wall grew, the Celestial Dragon and his children poured their magic into it, and so it became more than merely a barrier of stone, wood and steel, but one of will and determination.\\n	false

When Chaos flooded the world, the Celestial Dragon brought together and protected the tribes of the east.\\n\\nIn thanks, the humans took the Dragon as their Emperor and served him with loyal admiration. At the birth of Cathay, the Celestial Dragon took a mate, the Moon Empress, and with her had nine Draconic children to rule the land, watched over by their father and mother from the capital of Wei-Jin.\\n\\nThrough long years of stability and patience, though its enemies are many and its leaders not always in agreement, the Dragons have brought harmony to Cathay. The Dragons teach the philosophy of Yang and Yin, of balance in all things.\\n\\nThis goes so far as the Emperor and Empress themselves: the Celestial Dragon representing the embodiment of Yang –the power of light, heaven and fire; while the Moon Empress personifies Yin – the power of shadow, spirits and night. Together, they are two halves of one whole – just as Grand Cathay endures through a perfect balance of all things.\\n	false

This is Nehekhara, the cursed Land of the Dead, and the domain of the Tomb Rings.\\n\\nNehekhara was once a land of magnificent architecture and noble dynasties. Its warrior kings led golden armies against the barbarian tribes that envied the splendour of Nehekhara, and the Greenskin hordes that constantly threatened their realm. They fought their wars with phalanxes of spearmen that stretched across battlefields as far as the eye could see, with regiments of archers that darkened the skies with arrows and with battalions of deadly chariots that rumbled across the land.\\n\\nThe Nehekharans crushed all before them in displays of martial brilliance until their realm reached from the lizard-infested Southlands to the monster-haunted forests of the north. However, the vain kings refused to let mere death cheat them of their lifetime’s accomplishments or rob them of their worldly possessions.\\n\\nIt was the belief of every Nehekharan king that, upon his death, he would be mummified in an elaborate ceremony and interred within a magnificent burial pyramid. Here they would await the Day of Awakening, when they would arise into a golden paradise filled with all their subjects and belongings, which were necessarily entombed alongside their lords, and here would they reign supreme for all eternity.\\n\\nOver time, their necropolises became bigger and grander than the towns of the living.

The corrupt sorcerer Nagash instigated a great catastrophe that at once destroyed every living thing in Nehekhara, and raised the dead from their tombs. The Tomb Kings arose from their sleep of oblivion prematurely, albeit immortal and more powerful than ever.\\n\\nThe once-proud rulers of Nehekhara have been reborn into a mocking travesty of life. They have awoken from the slumber of death to discover that they are repulsive Undead creatures; bone-dry cadavers whose once palatial realms are but a shadow of their former splendour.\\n\\nThey found Nehekhara plagued by hordes of barbaric invaders; its ancient cities and proud statuary crumbling from long centuries of warfare and its bountiful riches plundered by countless tomb robbers. The Tomb Kings now fight to restore their vast empire to its former majesty, striking forth from the desert to reclaim the world from the living. \\n\\nThe Tomb Kings’ trusted advisors were their Liche Priests – wizards of great power whose sole task in life was to prepare the kings’ tombs and ensure their lasting immortality. When a king died, his Liche Priests would embalm his body in an elaborate funeral ceremony and inter his remains in preparation for the Day of Awakening.\\n\\nThe undying Liche Priests, withered and frail from the passing of untold centuries, are now responsible for watching over Nehekhara and for reawakening the armies of the Tomb Kings to glorious conquest.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_undying_legions_description	In ancient Nehekhara, a ruler was only as powerful as his force under arms. Thus, the kings maintained vast legions and proclaimed their victories proudly so that rivals would know of their strength and tremble. In this way, the names of many legions became legendary.\\n\\nKing Nekhesh’s Scorpion Legion, for example, halted several barbarian invasions and felled their foes with spears whose tips were fashioned from the black claws of giant scorpions. Similarly, Prince Sekhef’s Heralds of Death were feared for their grisly standard, from which the skulls of a dozen conquered kings hung, cursed by the Liche Priests of Numas to wail in perpetual torment. These and a thousand others have now awakened from death, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies once more.\\n\\nIt was the duty of every soldier to serve his king, not only in life but beyond into death. Countless thousands of loyal warriors were buried alive in the great tomb pits of the ancient kings. Assembled in serried ranks as though on parade, the legions of each king were entombed with all the weapons and regalia of war needed to protect their lord in the next life – bronze-tipped spears, curved swords and sturdy shields.\\n\\nMany archers were also buried with their masters, together with huge stockpiles of magically blessed arrows. Alongside the foot soldiery of the king’s legions were regiments of cavalry and gilded chariots, which awaited the day when they would gallop out of the mortuary-pyramids and crush their enemies once again.\\n\\nWhen the Tomb Kings advance to war, they do so with these vast legions at their command, a breathtaking sight of gleaming bone, gold and bronze. The Undead warriors stride unfalteringly across the searing desert and through howling sandstorms as they close in on their foes.\\n\\nVast phalanxes of skeletal soldiers advance towards their terrified enemies in relentless unison, fighting with a supernatural discipline that no mortal man can hope to match. Slowly but implacably, the legions of the Undead drive their foes before them, guided as always by the unyielding will of their Tomb King.\\n\\nThere are some necromantic spells that reanimate long-dead corpses, creating Undead automatons that serve the necromancer in a mindless fashion. Such is not the way of the Tomb Kings’ soldiers; each Skeleton in the numberless legions is inhabited by the soul of an ancient Nehekharan warrior.\\n\\nThrough the magical incantations of Liche Priests, spirits of loyal soldiers are summoned from the Realm of Souls and bound within corporeal remains. These warriors are not, then, slaves to the will of an evil wizard, but dutiful soldiers who unswervingly obey their king’s commands in death, just as they once had in life.\\n\\nHowever, without the extensive mummification techniques and magical wards of preservation laid upon the bodies of the Nehekharan royalty, the Skeletons of the Tomb Kings’ legions perceive the world very differently to mortal men. They retain only the most pertinent aspects of their former lives: the endless years of training and discipline, the martial skills honed on countless fields of battle and, above all else, their oaths of fealty to their king. Personality and ambition are ephemeral, and even their names have faded like half-forgotten dreams.\\n	false

These towering sculptures, made in the images of gods, kings and mythical creatures, were placed in and around the necropolises.\\n\\nTitanic warriors hewn from cliff-faces and giant beasts built from whitest marble, darkest obsidian and blood-forged gold stood sentry beside every entranceway. Ranks of imposing Ushabti – statuary carved in the images of a pantheon of ancient gods – lined the labyrinthine corridors of the burial pyramids. Monstrous sphinxes loomed over the sacred sarcophagi of the Tomb Kings themselves and countless other, more terrifying statues, lay buried and forgotten beneath the baking sands.\\n\\nThe Liche Priests learned long ago that the same incantations used to summon forth warrior-spirits could be adapted to animate the hulking stone forms of Nehekhara’s fearsome statuary. Ever since, when the Tomb Kings have made war upon their enemies, constructs of animated stone have fought beside them. These imposing figures wade through the ranks of mortals, crushing their opponents with terrible blows as enemy arrows and sword-strokes rebound harmlessly from their rock-hard frames.\\n\\nThe reborn Tomb Kings look upon their shattered lands and skeletal legions, and they are greatly angered. Nehekhara was once a powerful and proud nation, and its enemies cowered before the might of its kings and the strength of their armies. Year upon year its borders expanded, and with the conquered wealth magnificent monuments were raised to honour kings and gods. The Tomb Kings have vowed that all of Nehekhara must be restored. They will not stop until every city is rebuilt, every land re-conquered and every stolen treasure, even the most insignificant of trinkets, is recovered.\\n\\nSo as it once was, so will it be again.\\n	false

Their cries can be heard screaming in the wind as they cross the vast tracts of Nehekhara’s baking deserts, preying on those foolish enough to enter the cursed land in search of treasure.\\n\\nNehekhara is a hostile realm where the searing heat of the desert sun is the least of a wandering traveller’s worries. The waters of the Great Mortis River are poisonous and blood-coloured, providing no relief to the thirsty. There are regions of quicksand that can swallow regiments whole and choking sandstorms that strip the flesh from bones in mere seconds.\\n\\nWhirlwinds of dust, skulls and ravenous desert insects scour through the land, and rivers of flesh-eating beetles crawl across the desert, consuming everything in their path. There are vast plains of bones and skulls that come to life without warning, skeletal fingers reaching up to drag anything alive on the surface into a sandy grave below.\\n\\nA few oases still exist, scattered throughout the arid desert, but they are all tainted; instead of fresh water they are filled with bubbling pools of blood.

There are waterfalls of sand that defy the passage of time and flow backwards. There exist dunes and basins large enough to accommodate entire armies, and many of the Tomb King’s legions lie beneath the surface in such places – awaiting the magical incantations of Liche Priests to awaken them from their deathly slumber.\\n\\nA sandstorm might unearth a monolithic statue, or even an entire buried city, lost and forgotten under the dunes, only to be engulfed and concealed again a few days later. Such hidden places are said to include the mysterious City of Bronze, a complex rumoured to be covered in glyphs carved by beings older than Nehekhara itself.\\n\\nIn addition to open deserts, where sand stretches as far as the eye can see, there are vast necropolises and numerous places where one can hardly move for all the statues and sculptures, each covered with grisly images of death. These monuments are vaster and grander than anything the Old World can boast, and foremost amongst them are towering figures resembling the great kings and angry gods of Nehekhara – fearsome statues that come to life and smite trespassers with impunity.\\n\\nWhen the Tomb Kings awoke, they ordered their Undead minions to rebuild the cities of old and fill them with the markets, wares, boats, and other things that they remembered from life. As few trees grow in the Land of the Dead, many of these things are fashioned from stone, gold or fused bones.\\n\\nSkeletal men walk the lands fulfilling seemingly pointless jobs such as fetching stagnant water, harvesting crops long since withered or else rowing barges across the Great Mortis River. Armies of Skeletons are forever patrolling the borders of their realm as they did in life, relentlessly striding across the arid landscape in search of enemies and intruders.\\n\\nNumerous Undead creatures wander the deep desert, from swarms of small but deadly desert scorpions to giant centipedes, each the size of a sphinx. Great flocks of Carrion circle high above, and packs of ravenous sand sharks swim beneath the surface of the dunes.\\n\\nIn the centuries since Nagash’s Great Ritual, many foul monsters have been drawn to the magically tainted realm. There are now Manticores, Cockatrices and even Dragons inhabiting the Nehekharan desert.\\n\\nNomadic bandits make a living by plundering the tombs of ancient kings, and marauding Orc tribes continuously rampage across the Land of the Dead in search of battle and plunder.

But you aren’t getting a full share of what I find.”\\n\\nUncaring about what could be looted from the burial chamber, Mikel half ran down the long, thin corridor towards the welcome sight of the stars. Stepping from the cairn, he breathed in the cold air deeply, running a hand over his clammy forehead.\\n\\nPassing clouds hid the full moon for a moment, and the shadows deepened. In the darkness there was movement, and Mikel felt his heart skip a beat. From the other cairns, spread in a semi-circle around the largest of the burial mounds, came the sound of many slow, deliberate footfalls.\\n\\nAdorned in strange, ancient bronze armour, a parade of long-dead soldiers marched from the darkness of the crypts and arranged themselves into fighting formations. Strange totems were held by some of the skeletal soldiers, and others held silent bronze horns to fleshless lips.\\n\\nFrom one of the larger burial mounds a bronze chariot emerged, pulled by the horrific vision of a pair of horses, their flesh long since having fallen from their bones. As one, the skeletal legion began their advance, moving creakingly towards Mikel, skeletal hands clutching ancient weapons. Footsteps sounded behind him.\\n\\n“We ha-have t-to go, Heinrich,” he stammered. Hearing no reply. Mikel turned.\\n\\nHeinrich staggered into view, and Mikel let out a groan of horror. The skin on Heinrich’s face was grey and lined, as if he had aged a decade in the brief moments since he saw him. Heinrich raised a wrinkled hand, nails long and curling, towards Mikel in a silent plea.\\n\\nA heavy bronze blade suddenly chopped into Heinrich’s neck from behind him, nearly severing his head from his body. With a gurgling sigh he fell to the ground, blood fountaining from the terrible wound. Standing in the gloom was a mighty figure. bedecked in intricately carved, age-old bronze armour.\\n\\nNo sound issued from Mikel’s throat, though inside, his soul screamed. Staring into the empty sockets of the once great king, he got the distinct impression that a cold intelligence still resided within this being.\\n\\nMikel remained silently screaming and unmoving, even as the first blades pierced his body. He dropped to the ground, to be trampled into the icy earth. Only then, with all evidence of the intruders gone, did the ancient warriors return to their cairns, to guard their abodes silently for the remainder of eternity.\\n	false

settra_war_sand_snow_description	Settra the Imperishable had ruled as the Undead king of all Nehekhara for over a millennia when an army of marauding tribesmen from the frozen north made landfall on the baking shores of Nehekhara. The barbaric warriors plundered several tombs before the Skeleton Warriors of Settra’s legions began to rise from the sands to bar their escape.\\n\\nEven as the Marauders prepared to face this threat, the skies began to darken. The barbarians gazed to the heavens, and a heartbeat later, a cloud of arrows fell amongst them that cut down hundreds of warriors. In the wake of the volley, vast flocks of Carrion descended upon the wounded and the dying, razor-sharp beaks tearing open throats and bellies.\\n\\nThe tribe’s chieftain, Valgar the Butcher, ordered a savage counterattack, unleashing packs of bloodthirsty Warhounds that tore the Carrion apart in a frenzied gnashing of teeth. Valgar then redressed his surviving warriors’ ranks and prepared to meet the approaching Skeleton battle line.\\n\\nAxes clashed with spears as the two forces collided, but wherever Valgar fought. the Undead were hewn by his axe or crushed beneath the hooves of his daemonic steed. Despite Valgar’s fearsome skill, his forces were vastly outnumbered, and his own warriors were growing tired, their strength sapped by the punishing glare of the desert sun.\\n\\nIn the distance, Valgar could see a single figure emerge through the heat-haze, a majestic warrior riding forwards on a golden chariot. Valgar raised his rune-covered axe to the air and bellowed a challenge to the newcomer – a challenge that was answered with a rumble of thunder.\\n\\nThat figure was none other than Settra the Imperishable, and he smashed into the invaders with the wrath of ancient gods, driving a bloody path towards Valgar. As the two generals collided, Settra swung his enchanted blade in a mighty arc that decapitated Valgar’s daemonic mount in a single blow.\\n\\nEven as Valgar’s steed was slain from beneath him, the chieftain’s axe glowed with baleful energy, and it was suddenly wreathed in sorcerous flames. The axe bit deep into Settra’s chest and set his form ablaze. Before Valgar could enjoy his victory, Settra’s body exploded into a ravenous swarm of beetles that stripped the chieftain’s flesh from his bones before flying back to the Great Pyramid of Khemri to regenerate the Tomb King’s immortal form.\\n\\nAmidst the carnage, Valgar’s lieutenant, Khagul Bloodfist, stooped down to pick up Settra’s regal crown before rallying the surviving tribesmen and driving a path through the skeletal shield-wall back to the coast. Only a dozen Marauders managed to survive and escape back to their frozen realm, bloodied, but rich beyond their wildest dreams.\\n	false

settra_settras_revenge_description	It was a decade before Settra remerged from his sarcophagus, his body restored but his heart burning with the need for vengeance. The men of the north had not only dared to enter his realm, soiling the desert with their barbaric feet, they had the temerity to face him in battle, even going so far as to strike him down.\\n\\nHowever, most heinous of all crimes had been the bold act of laying their lowborn hands upon the Crown of Nehekhara – a deed that brought with it a sentence of death. Settra the Imperishable would punish the barbarians for their insolence by staining the snows of their homeland red with their blood.\\n\\nThe King of Nehekhara turned to his Liche Priests and ordered them to awaken his vassal kings; the combined might of Khemri’s armies was going to war. Settra’s war fleets sailed north, towards the frozen wastelands, laden with legions of Undead soldiers and war-constructs. The King of Nehekhara swore that only when every last gold coin was recovered, and every one of the barbarians who had escaped his wrath a decade ago was slain, would he return to Khemri.\\n\\nEach of those men had become a chieftain in his own right, with the wealth they brought back from the Land of the Dead securing them much power and many followers. Several had become Champions of Chaos and now they led whole tribes of merciless warriors and mutated monsters.\\n\\nSettra’s warhost collided with the iron-clad Warriors of Chaos across the entire length of the northern lands. Enormous statues strode relentlessly through driving blizzards, and regiments of Skeleton Chariots tirelessly ploughed through snowdrifts in their hunt for the guilty.\\n\\nUntold thousands of men were slaughtered upon the swords and spears of Settra’s host as tribe after tribe was destroyed. Dragon Ogres were cut down by powerful Ushabti, Trolls were turned into pillars of sand by Sepulchral Stalkers and grotesque Giants were slain by the monstrous claws of ferocious Necrosphinxes.\\n\\nDriven by Settra’s unyielding will, the legions of Nehekhara were unstoppable. Within five years only one of the dozen Mauraders remained alive, and only a single treasure – the Crown of Nehekhara – remained unclaimed. Settra’s revenge was almost at hand.\\n	false

settra_dead_damned_description	After a long trek across the Hellwyrm Glacier, Settra’s legions clashed with the warhost of Khagul Bloodfist – the last and most powerful of the Marauders and the one who had stolen Settra’s crown all those years ago. In the intervening years, Khagul’s victories had seen him become a mighty Champion of Chaos, imbued with the power of Dark Gods whose names men fear to speak.\\n\\nKhagul commanded a great horde of Chaos, for his fame was such that tribesmen and warbands from leagues around flocked to his blood-drenched banner. It was not only the Chaos Gods who had noticed the deeds of this warrior, for Prince Apophas, the Cursed Scarab Lord, saw in Khagul a soul that might be the equal of his own; a spirit that could buy his freedom from the tortures of the Nehekharan Underworld. So it was that whilst Settra led the fight against the assembled Chaos horde, carving his way through their armoured ranks, Apophas ambushed the unsuspecting Khagul.\\n\\nThe Chaos Champion had just finished dismembering a Tomb Scorpion when he was suddenly enveloped by a swarm of black beetles, which obscured his vision before coalescing into a shape resembling that of a man. The figure clutched a dagger in one hand, and his leering skull seemed to stare into Khagul’s very soul.\\n\\nWithout pause, Khagul’s bodyguard launched themselves at the assassin, but the figure opened its mouth and vomited forth a surge of insects that drowned them beneath chitinous bodies. Apophas stalked towards his target, and Khagul readied his axe.\\n\\nThe Chaos Champion hacked at the figure with frenzied swipes, but it was to no avail. Every time Khagul cut into Apophas’ body a tide of scuttling scarabs would flow over the wound. In frustration, he raised his axe high above his head, preparing to strike the assassin’s skull from its shoulders but, before the stroke fell, Apophas had slashed his dagger across the champion’s throat.\\n\\nKhagul’s blood burst forth in an arterial spray, and he slumped to his knees. Apophas drew the warrior’s soul from his mortal body, capturing it before dragging it into the Underworld for all eternity.\\n\\nWith the death of Khagul, the cohesion the Chaos warhost crumbled. The northern tribesmen reverted to their crude, berserk nature, and they were easily dashed against Settra’s disciplined battle lines. The King of all Nehekhara smashed into the ranks of mortals time and again, leaving a trail of fire and death in his wake.\\n\\nAgainst this onslaught, the hearts of men faltered, and the barbaric tribesmen turned tail and fled, only to be run down by regiments of Undead cavalry that Settra had positioned for just such a task. Only the armoured warriors of the Chaos host stood their ground, and they fought against Khemri’s war-statues in a clash of steel and stone, but when Settra’s chariot legions smashed into the Chaos Warriors’ flanks, they too were massacred.\\n\\nIt would be two more days before Settra’s legions butchered the final remnants of the Chaos horde, the bloody campaign ending when Settra himself charged through a hailstorm to slay a lightning wreathed Shaggoth. The show plains were littered with the bodies of dead, and from amidst the corpses Settra retrieved the bloodstained Crown of Nehekhara.\\n\\nSettra’s treasures had finally been recovered, and those who had wronged him now lay dead at his feet. Such was the fate for any who dared oppose the will of Settra the Imperishable.\\n	false

settra_rise_settra_description	The ancient kingdom of Nehekhara was at its most powerful when the men of the Old World were still primitive and savage – about two and a half millennia before the coming of the barbarian hero Sigmar Heldenhammer.\\n\\nThrough centuries of work and culture, Nehekhara, known to its people as the Great Land, was built into a powerful civilisation. Its people built great cities out of white stone and carved marble. They constructed vast roads and fleets of ships to connect each city to its neighbours.\\n\\nMighty kings, whose every whim was law, ruled the people. Vast armies of disciplined soldiers were raised and trained in the king’s name, and those that invaded their cities were mercilessly cut down. Greatest of these cities was Khemri – the City of Kings – and by tradition, whoever ruled there was considered first amongst equals.\\n\\nThe other cities were each governed by their own king, though all were expected to show loyalty and pay tribute to Khemri. Together, these kings subdued the tribes in the surrounding lands, drove back the Greenskin hordes that plagued the realm, and ruled from the western Deserts of Araby to the eastern Sea of Dread.\\n\\nAt the height of Nehekhara’s power, it had expanded and conquered lands as far north as what is now laughably called the Empire, south into the primordial jungles of the Southlands and even east into the foreboding Dark Lands. The kings’ armies marched across the world subjugating all before them, and their vast fleets of galleys and war barques terrorised the Great Ocean.\\n	false

To this end, they began to war upon each other. Over the following years, the Crown of Nehekhara, a symbol of rulership over all of the Great Land, passed from king to conquering king. Dozens of kings rose and fell during this time, so many that their names are not remembered, but it is known that none had the strength to prevail or maintain power for long.\\n\\nWith every Nehekharan city’s military might turned upon its neighbours, the Great Land was open to attack from invaders. The city of Lybaras was almost completely destroyed by the scaled creatures that lurked within the southern jungles.\\n\\nNumerous Greenskin hordes and barbarous tribes of men descended from the north, destroying and slaughtering as they rampaged unchecked across Nehekhara. During this time, the Great Land was also stricken with drought and plague.\\n\\nNo single city’s army, exhausted as they were from disease, starvation and unremitting civil war, could hope to hold back the tide alone, but the arrogant and distrustful kings refused to put aside their differences to form a lasting alliance, bow their knee to another or halt in their pursuit of domination over their rivals. The first great civilisation of Man stood on the brink of destruction. Unless the Nehekharans could be unified, they would all perish.\\n	false

settra_settra_great_description	The Nehekharan priesthood saw the strife in the Great Land as a sign that the gods were angered, but their warnings and protestations to the warring kings fell on deaf ears. That all changed with the coming of Settra.\\n\\nOf all the kings of Nehekhara, none could match the splendour, cruelty and arrogance of Settra, the newly crowned king of Khemri. He was a vain and egotistical man and demanded not only the obedience, but also the adoration of his subjects.\\n\\nHowever, Settra was no fool, and when he listened to his priests he realised that only a leader who could command the respect of the gods would earn the full adulation of the people. To this end, Settra, alone amongst all the kings of Nehekhara, paid homage to the ancient gods; early in his reign he ordered the restoration of temples and erected many magnificent statues to be built in their honour.\\n\\nOn the first anniversary of his coronation, Settra beseeched the gods to restore Khemri to its former glory and grant him the strength to conquer his rivals, sacrificing his own children in a grand ritual to show his commitment and prove his worth. The next day, the Great Vitae River flooded for the first time in several decades.\\n\\nWith the waters, disease was washed away from Khemri, and the crop harvest was plentiful for the first time in living memory. This was seen as a sign by both the Nehekharan priesthood and the populace of Khemri that Settra was indeed chosen by the gods. So it was that Settra became the first Priest King of Khemri, a ruler who commanded not only the unswerving loyalty of his people and his legions, but who also wielded the power of the gods.\\n	false

He was a ruthless warlord, and his keen tactical and strategic sense was matched only by his courage and martial skill.\\n\\nOne by one, Settra brought the other great cities of Nehekhara to heel, leading his legions from the front where he could sate his own battle-lust and thirst to conquer. First Numas fell, then Zandri surrendered, and with every victory more warriors flocked to his banner.\\n\\nBefore long, Settra commanded the largest and most devout army that Nehekhara had ever known. Vast legions of battle-hardened soldiers marched across the land at Settra’s command, and no mercy was shown to those who dared opposed his might.\\n\\nUnder Settra’s inspired and unparalleled generalship, all the kings of Nehekhara were conquered, forced to swear oaths of fealty, pay tribute and acknowledge Khemri as the preeminent city of the land once more. Having subjugated his rivals through bloody conquest, Settra had ended the civil war and the Time of Strife.\\n	false

Settra’s agents would root out and quell any trace of dissent and the merest hint of rebellion that threatened the stability of their lord’s realm, and soon none dared to even think of defying the King of Khemri. Thereafter, Settra reigned as the undisputed king of not just Khemri, but of all Nehekhara, and for many decades he suffered no challenge to his rule.\\n\\nThough Settra was a ruthless and tyrannical ruler, Khemri, and indeed the whole of Nehekhara, entered a golden age of prosperity under his rule. The war-ravaged cities were quickly restored, and many grand monuments were erected to not just the gods, but now also to the honour of Settra. Mighty legions of soldiers were raised to secure Nehekhara’s ever-expanding borders and repel the many mutated monsters and savage barbarians that had sunk their claws into the Great Land during the Time of Strife.\\n\\nYet Settra was not content with merely restoring the kingdoms of his ancestors. The armies of Nehekhara spread far and wide, conquering the surrounding lands and enslaving their tribes. Settra’s war fleets ravaged realms across the seas, and his armies brought the terror of the Priest King of Khemri to many distant lands.\\n\\nForeign cities fell, faraway lands were conquered and vast riches were brought back to the Great Land from as far afield as the jungles of Lustria. Nehekhara reached the peak of its power and influence during the reign of Settra, and his name was feared across half the world.\\n	false

settra_unreachable_vision_description	There was nothing that could stay Settra’s hunger for war, nor his thirst for conquest, and for many years the armies of Nehekhara swept across the world. Settra’s vast kingdom stretched across the lands, but for all his victories and accomplishments, the Priest King was unsatisfied.\\n\\nIt is said that in the fortieth year of his reign, with his body beginning to show the first signs of old age and frailty, Settra stood in the peaks of the Black Mountains, upon the very edge of his empire, and surveyed all that he had conquered. He then turned and gazed upon the distant lands that lay on the other side of the mountain and roared in anger. It was with bitter disappointment that Settra realised that even if he lived for a hundred years, there would still be realms beyond his grasp.\\n\\nSettra simmered with rage, for he knew that one day he would be defeated, not by a mortal foe, nor by any superior army – for surely there were none – but by the cruel passage of time and his own mortality. Settra knew that his dreams of global conquest were unreachable in his mortal lifespan, and though the fires of ambition still burned brightly within his heart, his body would wither and fail him before he could see his vision fulfilled.\\n\\nWorse, Settra recognised that death might rob him of all he had achieved: his lands, his people, and his power. Over the following months he became ever more obsessed, demanding audiences with the wisest priests and scholars in the land to discuss how the intolerable problem of his mortality might be overcome. In his arrogance, he vowed that the grave would not claim him, and set in motion events that would forever change his kingdom.\\n	false

settra_mortuary_cult_description	Settra became obsessed with unlocking the secrets of immortality so that he could rule over his lands for all eternity. In his quest for everlasting life, Settra founded the Mortuary Cult and demanded that his wisest and most powerful priests devote their efforts to discovering the secrets of preventing his passing. The priests of Khemri did as Settra bade them, and for years they brewed potions, recited incantations and travelled into unknown lands in search of the secret that would overcome death.\\n\\nIn their research, the priests learned much, and they used their powers to extend Settra’s life far beyond its natural span. However, they could not halt the passage of time indefinitely – they were merely postponing the inevitability of death while their lord’s mortal body became ever more frail. The priests of the Mortuary Cult were naturally reluctant to reveal these limitations to Settra, whose wrath was legendary, and continued to search in vain for a way to accomplish their appointed task.\\n\\nThe priests journeyed for many years throughout the world. They studied all aspects of death, and over the years they learned much, and their powers grew. Using their arcane knowledge, the priests extended the length of their own lives, even as they continued their work.\\n\\nThey learned how to preserve a corpse from decay, until the art of mummification had become very elaborate indeed. With the passing of the years, the hierophants of the Mortuary Cult had even begun to experiment with harnessing the Winds of Magic – the power of the gods themselves.\\n\\nThough they made incredible progress, it was to no avail; true immortality lay beyond their power. Great was Settra’s wrath, for though the priests’ magic kept him alive far beyond the span of a mortal man, they could not prevent his death.\\n\\nHowever, the Mortuary Cult had devised a vast lore of magical incantations and rituals, which they claimed could bridge the gap between the mortal world and the Realm of Souls. They believed that with careful preparation and the proper incantations, it might be possible for the dead to return to life in imperishable bodies – though it may take many centuries to perfect and perform the necessary rituals. Left with no other choice, Settra commanded that a vast burial tomb be constructed for his body to rest within until the Mortuary Cult finished their work and he could be reborn into the eternal existence he so craved.\\n	false

When the king perished, it was with a curse on his lips. Powerful incantations were intoned over his corpse, and he was embalmed in a great ritual.\\n\\nPreserved against decay, the body of Settra was entombed within a mighty sarcophagus in the heart of a majestic pyramid of shining white stone. The monument was so bright that it hurt mortal eyes just to look upon it. The pyramid was vast, and it towered over the city of Khemri.\\n\\nIt was the largest and most magnificent monument ever created in Nehekhara, for no simple cairn would befit a king as mighty and powerful as Settra. All of his treasures, along with his most loyal servants and bodyguards, were also interred within his pyramid.\\n\\nSettra’s mighty legions, which had carved out his realm at his behest, were arrayed deep beneath it in colossal tomb pits. Loyal even unto death, these soldiers were buried alive in preparation for the Day of Awakening when Settra would arise and lead them to war once more. At the head of the funeral procession strode Nekaph, Settra’s most loyal servant, mummified at the right-hand side of his beloved king, in order to serve him in the next life.\\n\\nFor thousands of years afterwards, the priests of Khemri tended the funeral flames outside the sealed tomb nurturing Settra’s immortal spirit with sacrifice and incantations in preparation for the Day of Awakening. No tomb before or since has ever had such powerful hieroglyphs of warding and incantations of protection heaped upon it. During this time, the priests of the Mortuary Cult continued to develop their understanding of magical incantations in the hopes of finally unlocking the secrets of immortality and of bringing about the time of Settra’s resurrection.\\n	false

However, without Settra’s stern control and merciless leadership, no single Priest King had the ability to rule over all of Nehekhara. Thus, the individual cities vied and competed with each other over riches and status.\\n\\nThough Nehekhara did not revert to the all-out civil wars of the Time of Strife, skirmishes between neighbouring cities were not unheard of. During this centuries-long era, known as the Time of Kings, the borders of Nehekhara were as changing as the shifting dunes. What existed was a feudal state where power and territory were decided by strength of arms. A king was only as powerful as the size of his armies, and so vast legions were raised with each passing decade.\\n\\nThough the expansion of the Great Land did not proceed at the same pace as it had during the reign of Settra, every now and then a warrior-king would extend his realm, either by conquering his neighbours or by pacifying some of the savage lands surrounding Nehekhara. Armies of highly disciplined warriors and fearsome chariots warred against the Priest Kings’ enemies.\\n\\nIn the west, the crude desert nomads were subjugated and their chieftains enlightened by the great civilisation of Nehekhara. In the north and the south, the Priest Kings fought many battles against tribes of Greenskins, barbaric men and crocodilian lizard-warriors. These wars brought much wealth to Nehekhara, and slave gangs toiled like ants, hauling their prizes back to the necropolises.\\n\\nGold was taken from the strongholds of the bearded mountain-dwellers, precious jewels from reptilian temple-cities, exotic stone from as far away as distant Cathay, and fresh slaves from the primitive lands to the north that would one day become known as the Empire. Almost the entirety of this conquered wealth was spent in raising larger legions of soldiers and in the construction of ever-more elaborate tombs.\\n	false

To the Cathayans, the Nehekharans seemed superstitious, leading lives governed by the worship of a sprawling pantheon of gods, the adulation of which governed every aspect of their day to day lives.\\n\\nAmongst the priests of Nehekhara, tales of the immortal Celestial Dragon and his mighty dynasty proved captivating, and the devotees of Nehekhara’s Mortuary Cult devoted much to learning the secrets of Xen Yang’s power and longevity, secrets his representatives in far Nehekhara refused to be drawn on.\\n\\nYet, despite the secrets that remained between the two great nations, their alliance grew ever stronger, and the armies of Grand Cathay marched often beside the warriors of ancient Nehekhara, bringing war to the wild and desolate Darklands. From these joint campaigns into the monster infested wilderness, both nations prospered, Grand Cathay by opening up safer and more secure trade routes and increasing the steady flow of merchant caravans travelling east and west, Nehekhara by eagerly expanding its borders towards the distant horizon.\\n	false

However, just as with Settra, none could escape death’s embrace, so they maintained the Mortuary Cult in order to reawaken them after their passing.\\n\\nDuring this time, the power and influence of the Mortuary Cult grew. The first generation of priests, whose skills were comparatively rudimentary, died after prolonging their lives far beyond their natural span. They passed on their knowledge to the next generation who exceeded them in both wisdom and expertise.\\n\\nIn this way, the Mortuary Cult’s skill accumulated until the fifth generation of priests discovered the secrets of binding their souls into their bodies and did not die. After long years of perseverance and endless research, they had finally unlocked the secrets of eternal life, and though they had not perfected the necessary incantations, the ability to awaken the deceased kings from the sleep of death was almost in their grasp as well.\\n\\nHowever, the priesthood, whose members had become known as the Liche Priests, were very careful to keep the secrets of their magical lore to themselves. They had gained unprecedented power and enjoyed a dominion over the lands of Nehekhara second only to that of the royalty themselves, and they were reluctant to give that status up.\\n\\nThe Liche Priests reasoned that, so long as the Priest Kings had need of the Mortuary Cult to reawaken them into a golden paradise, nothing would change and they could officiate in perpetuity. Whilst the Liche Priests continued to develop their lore of magical incantations, they witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, and still they did not die.

Skulls and skeletons became common symbols of immortality and everlasting life, and such motifs were emblazoned on the shields, banners and chariots of the Priest Kings’ armies.\\n\\nHeroic warriors were rewarded not with riches and luxuries in life, but with the promise of mummification upon death and the chance of sharing in their lord’s eternal rule. It was not just the culture of Nehekhara that changed as the Mortuary Cult grew in power; as the Nehekharans’ obsession with death flourished, the architecture and landscape of the Great Land irrevocably changed as well.\\n\\nEvery Priest King demanded that his pyramid outdo the efforts of his predecessors in order to prove his superiority. Though none had the audacity to surpass the majesty of the Great Pyramid of Settra, ever-bigger monuments were raised to honour the achievements of the kings. Titanic statues were carved to stand guard over their remains, keeping them secure through all eternity.\\n\\nBefore long, all efforts of the people were expended in building and maintaining the necropolises. Necrotects directed the construction as Liche Priests oversaw the mummification rituals that the Priest Kings believed would one day lead to their resurrection. Soon, lesser nobles demanded similar rites and had tombs of their own constructed beside the royal pyramids.\\n\\nOver centuries, as hundreds of royal lines and their armies were entombed, the shining necropolises of the dead outgrew the now meagre-looking dwellings of the living.

As the firstborn son of King Khetep of Khemri, Nagash was destined to serve in the Mortuary Cult whilst his younger brother, Thutep, ascended to rule following their father’s death.\\n\\nNagash was an exceptionally gifted student, and due to his talents and heritage he quickly became one of Khemri’s High Priests, but this did not sate his thirst for power. Filled with pride and greed, Nagash coveted the throne held by his brother and set into motion a plot to seize the crown for himself.\\n\\nNagash began to corrupt the religious incantations of the Mortuary Cult, and he gathered together a dozen like-minded acolytes, of which a cruel noble named Arkhan was the foremost. One night, as the clouds covered the moon. Nagash murdered Thuten’s bodyguard before entombing the young king alive within the Great Pyramid of their father. The next morning, blood still staining his hands, Nagash placed himself on the throne, and none dared confront him.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_arch_necromancer_description	The reign of Nagash was a time of terror for all the people of Nehekhara. The usurper king sought to increase his own power by means of devilish sorcery; a blasphemy that the people of Nehekhara felt certain would incur the wrath of the gods.\\n\\nNagash had learned the art of Dark Magic from a cabal of shipwrecked Dark Elves, captured and imprisoned within his father’s pyramid on the eve of his funeral. Nagash tortured the pale-skinned foreigners until they divulged the secrets of their mystical powers, and he proved to be an apt pupil indeed. After only a few years, Nagash had surpassed his tutors’ powers, and he destroyed them in a deadly magical duel as they tried to escape.\\n\\nNagash began to experiment with necromancy, combining his mastery of Dark Magic with his knowledge of death from the Mortuary Cult. He committed his findings into nine accursed tomes – the Books of Nagash – the most powerful source of necromantic magic in the world.\\n\\nOne of Nagash’s chief successes was the creation of the cursed Elixir of Life. With it, Nagash had finally unlocked the secret of eternal youth. He allowed Arkhan, his trusted vizier, and his other principal lieutenants, to imbibe the elixir. It granted them immortality and incredible strength but, unable to recreate the potion themselves, they were little more than slaves to Nagash’s sinister will.\\n\\nTo increase his power and maintain dominance over the land, Nagash built a vast black pyramid. Though the populace thought this was just another burial tomb, it was in fact a structure that could channel and harness the Winds of Magic to Nagash’s every whim.\\n\\nHowever, the tribute exacted by Khemri to build the pyramid was so great that the poverty-wracked cities of Nehekhara had begun to fall into ruin. Eventually, the other Priest Kings rallied against the tyranny of Khemri. They refused to submit to Nagash any longer, and they began to draw their plans against him.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_war_dead_description	To face the defiant Priest Kings, Nagash used his infernal powers to raise a legion of Skeleton Warriors. This was the first time that the dead were made to walk at the will of another, and the horror of it caused many mortal soldiers to flee before the Undead armies. City after city fell before Nagash, and though the living warriors of Nehekhara fought bravely, every soldier who fell only served to swell the ranks of the Undead.\\n\\nNagash believed it was only a matter of time before the Priest Kings relented and bent their knees in supplication once more, but his arrogance was to prove his undoing, for he underestimated both their resolve and pride. After many long years, the remaining Priest Kings threw all their strengths and hopes into one final gambit, and the combined armies of seven kings marched upon Khemri.\\n\\nIt was not only flesh and blood warriors who besieged Khemri, for beside the Priest Kings’ armies strode towering statues. Faced with destruction by Nagash’s sorcery, the Mortuary Cult had finally decided to take action and put their centuries of magical research into practice on the battlefield.\\n\\nIn a grand ritual, they summoned the spirits of ancient heroes from the Realm of Souls and bound them into the numerous statues that lined the passageways of the necropolises. The god-like Ushabti, towering Necrolith Colossi and powerful Khemrian Warsphinxes were awakened, ready to be directed to war. With creations such as these fighting at their side, the living warriors of Nehekhara were emboldened, and they crashed into the Undead legions with devastating force.\\n\\nAfter a titanic battle, Nagash’s forces were defeated by the Army of the Seven Kings. Khemri was besieged, and then sacked. Nagash’s immortal lieutenants, who had taken refuge in the cursed Black Pyramid, were dragged out of their sarcophagi into the sunlight one by one, and executed by the vengeful Priest Kings.\\n\\nHowever, Nagash managed to escape before the Priest Kings found his tomb thanks to the sacrifice of Arkhan, who stalled the attackers long enough for his master to flee. With a curse on his lips, Nagash vowed to turn the entire world into a kingdom of the dead, and travelled north to plot his revenge.\\n	false

The individual city rulers had exhausted their populace in overthrowing Nagash, and they now had to contend with famines, civil wars and marauding barbarians from distant lands.\\n\\nThe treachery of Nagash had also tarnished the authority of the royal lines, and it was not until several centuries later that a truly powerful king arose. Alcadizaar, a ruler the likes of which had not been seen since the days of Settra, ascended to the rule of Khemri. Under his wise and charismatic leadership, Alcadizaar bound the Great Cities under his rule, and Nehekhara began to prosper once more.\\n\\nThrough him, Nehekhara shone with light and majesty that had never before been seen in its history, so powerful that it may have eclipsed Settra’s own dynasty.

The Liche Priests were forbidden from deviating from their age-old lore of incantations, which had remained unchanged for centuries. However, the lords of the city of Lahmia hungered for power over their rivals.\\n\\nThey saw in Nagash’s sorcery the means not only to dominate all of Nehekhara, but also the chance to live forever and sever their dependence on the Mortuary Cult. To this end, they stole one of the blasphemous Books of Nagash from the Black Pyramid, and over the course of centuries they secretly become adept practitioners of necromancy.\\n\\nThe queen of Lahmia, Neferata, embraced the malign magic and used her powers to consort with daemonic entities. She created a tainted version of Nagash’s elixir, extending her life indefinitely, yet cursing herself for all eternity.\\n\\nNot possessing the skill or knowledge of Nagash, Neferata and her court were struck by an unquenchable thirst for mortal blood. Lahmia had become the birthplace of the Vampires – fell creatures whose individual strength and unholy power were greater than that of a dozen men.\\n\\nFearful that necromancy would bring about the wrath of the gods, King Alcadizaar made war on the tainted Vampire queen. Alcadizaar gathered legions from every other Nehekharan city and forged them into a single massed army that he led against Lahmia.\\n\\nThousands of chariots raced across the land ahead of vast regiments of archers, mighty phalanxes of spearmen and battalions of giant war-statues. Against such a host, not even the accursed Vampires could prevail, and the power of Lahmia was smashed. The pale queen fled, accompanied by those she had embraced into her cursed vampiric existence.\\n	false

gen_lore_tmb_dead_return_description	Unbeknownst to the Vampires, they had been guided by the implacable will of Nagash since their creation. Residing far away in his fortress, Nagashizzar, amid the mountains to the north-east of Nehekhara, the arch-necromancer recognised the spawn of his own ancient evil and was gladdened by the corruption of Lahmia.\\n\\nHere were worthy champions, their damnation a tribute to his dark genius. Drawing them to him, Nagash welcomed the Vampires, and they became his dark captains. Through them, Nagash began a new offensive against Nehekhara, and the two sides fought numerous battles – the outcomes of which would pave the way for the necromancer’s inevitable return.\\n\\nBeside the Vampires came the dead warriors of a vast host, Skeletons drawn from the tombs and cairns of the northern lands by the power of Nagash’s sorcery. Nagash resurrected his trusted servant, Arkhan the Black, who won many victories in his master’s name.\\n\\nWar assailed Nehekhara for years on end, and the land was irredeemably scarred. However, Alcadizaar was the greatest general of his age, and he led the unified army of Nehekhara against Nagash’s evil for all their long years of battle. Under his leadership, the living legions of Nehekhara never yielded, and finally, during the Battle of the Golden Skull, the Undead hordes of Nagash were repulsed from Nehekhara.\\n\\nThe Vampires scattered throughout the world to escape destruction, and without their magic and leadership, their armies of Skeletons crumbled. Nagash had been defeated. There was much rejoicing throughout Nehekhara, though the evil sorcerer himself still walked the land.\\n	false

He polluted the Great Vitae River, poisoning it until it turned thick and dark, tainting the lands that relied on its life-bringing waters. Forever after it was known as the Great Mortis River.\\n\\nPestilence and disease ran rampant across the Great Land. Within a few weeks, those who had succumbed to the terrible plagues outnumbered the living. The city streets were choked with corpses as fully nine-tenths of the Nehekharan population perished.\\n\\nMourning for his lost people, Alcadizaar sat upon his throne as his kingdom was destroyed – for all his skill at arms, he was powerless. Nagash’s Undead forces marched upon Khemri, brushing aside the city’s plague-ravaged guard with impunity and walking past the fortress walls and siege-barracks unchallenged. His Skeleton Warriors broke into Khemri’s royal palace and dragged Alcadizaar away to rot in a dungeon cell. For the first time in centuries, Nagash sat upon the throne of Khemri.\\n	false

Filled with insane visions of power, he returned to Nagashizzar and began to cast the greatest and most terrifying spell ever conceived. He intended to enact the Great Ritual, a spell powerful enough to resurrect every corpse across the globe and bind them under his control.\\n\\nWith them, Nagash would command an unstoppable army of the dead that he could use to conquer the entire world. To power his Great Ritual, he consumed vast quantities of warpstone and summoned all the energies stored within his cursed Black Pyramid.\\n\\nAs Nagash chanted within his fortress, the sky began to darken for hundreds of miles around and the ground shook. As his spell reached its crescendo, a great wave of power surged from the sorcerer’s body, washing over the lands of Nehekhara and stealing the life from everything in its path. Crops shrivelled and animals perished within seconds. The last people of Nehekhara fell to the ground, their skin withering as if they had aged a century in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nWithin minutes, there was not a single living creature in the entirety of Nehekhara. Such was Nagash’s execration of Alcadizaar, who had thwarted his plans for so long, that he spared the imprisoned king to witness the horrifying fate that had befallen his former kingdom.\\n	false

Through sheer force of will, Alcadizaar summoned the strength to swing his baleful sword and cut the hated necromancer down.\\n\\nAs Nagash died, the energies of his accursed spell spiralled out of his control and swept across his homeland.

Having long been suspicious of the motives of the Mortuary Cult, Xen Yang was suddenly presented with justification for his caution, and he quickly withdrew his representatives from the cities of Nehekhara and its many distant outposts.\\n\\nIn the centuries that followed, Xen Yang turned his attention towards strengthening his own realm. Despite his industry, the fall of Nehekhara caused the Celestial Dragon to grow melancholic. He had seen a young and vibrant nation of Man wiped out by the evil of a single individual. He had witnessed magics of such vile potency unleashed that he, the Dragon that had slain the most terrible lords of the æther, knew a moment of fear at the thought of ever having to face Nagash upon the field of battle.\\n	false

However, protected and shielded to a degree by the wards and incantations placed upon their pyramids and necropolises, Nagash’s spell affected the long-dead kings and their buried legions differently.\\n\\nAfter centuries of entombment, the stiffened corpses of monarchs and heroes awoke. The mummified kings rose from their resting places. Legions of Skeleton Warriors burst forth from their sand-filled tomb pits, ready to do their liege’s bidding.\\n\\nDue to the incantations of preservation performed on their embalmed bodies, the Tomb Kings awoke from their long journey through the Realm of Souls with their memories and faculties intact. They emerged from their tombs in horror.\\n\\nWhere the ancient kings had been promised eternal life in a paradise where they would rule supreme, they instead awoke to find themselves clad in desiccated flesh and rotten vestments, with their cities shattered, their lands desolate and their kingdoms all but destroyed – little more than ruins poking out from beneath the sand dunes.\\n	false

The fires of ambition and pride that had driven them in life still resided in their ancient bodies, and they instantly set out to reclaim their empires as best they could.\\n\\nKings who were great and powerful in life, who had reigned unchallenged for centuries, now awoke from death in a land where they were but one amongst hundreds. All believed the right to rule the land was solely theirs, and none would relinquish their perceived power.\\n\\nDynasties that were built upon the shoulders of more powerful monarchs were forced to confront their founders, and there were long battles in the necropolises as king fought king. Undying legions arose at their command, and many thousands of Skeleton Warriors were destroyed as the Undead Tomb Kings struggled for supremacy.\\n\\nOf all the tombs and pyramids, only one remained silent and untouched by the fighting – the Great Pyramid of Settra the Imperishable. The wards heaped on the white burial monument had protected the mummified corpse of Settra from Nagash’s tainted sorcery, and its occupants still slumbered in the sleep of death oblivious to the tumult of battle taking place outside the pyramid walls.\\n\\nAs the battles raged, the Liche Priests looked on. Their bodies, already extended far beyond their natural span, were unaffected by Nagash’s spell. They had survived the rise and fall of Nagash, whose sorcerous power they could not match, but it looked like the warring Tomb Kings were going to destroy what remained of Nehekhara.\\n\\nThe head of the Mortuary Cult, Grand Hierophant Khatep, oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, took it upon himself to restore order.

Settra waded into the carnage. His Herald, Nekaph, stood as ever by his side.

Not even Arkhan the Black, with his command of dark sorcery, could prevail against Settra’s strength of arms, and he was forced to flee Khemri.

The golden paradise he was promised did not exist, and worst of all, it appeared as if the ancient gods had abandoned Nehekhara.\\n\\nGrand Hierophant Khatep cowered before the outraged king and told the history of Nehekhara since his passing over two thousand years before. As best he could, Khatep told Settra of the spell that the foul Nagash had cast, cursing Nehekhara for all time.\\n\\nSettra listened with a barely controlled rage simmering within him. Once he had learned all he could from Khatep, he commanded that the Tomb Kings return to their eternal rest. The Liche Priests were given the duty of watching over the tombs and of awakening his vassal kings as needed. Settra vowed that he would stay vigilant, taking stock of the world and waging war as was his wont. Never again would he slumber, lest his kingdom slide into ruin.\\n\\nSettra set about restoring his former empire without delay. In particular, he watched for the return of the hated Nagash, who had cursed his realm, for he knew that the necromancer might yet reappear in the world and that Nagash’s sorcery could still threaten his immortality. \\n\\nSo it was that Nehekhara became the Land of the Dead and Settra the Imperishable renewed his rulership, which would become known as the Reign of Millions of Years.\\n	false

gen_lore_kho_crimson_skull_description	The Cult of the Crimson Skull is a secretive organisation that infiltrates warrior fraternities to transform them into unwitting tools of Khorne. As with any of Khorne’s bloody followers, Crimson Skulls perform blood sacrifice and spread mayhem, but they are pragmatic enough to understand they have no chance for survival if they blindly embrace the rage and hatred so favoured by the Blood God and his followers.\\n\\nInstead, they glorify their master by turning the hearts of noble warriors towards the worship of Chaos. These men and women become some of the violent in the Empire, and have spread into nearly all of the Imperial military societies. Ruthless, and dedicated to toppling the power structures to make way for a new and bloody kingdom that will rest on a mountain of skulls, they believe they are but a few steps away from victory.\\n\\nThe Crimson Skulls have spread their influence throughout the Brotherhood of the Axe and other military institutions. Even with the Ar-Ulric’s acceptance of Magnus the Pious, the seeds of doubt and hatred of Sigmar within the cult of Ulric still run hot. The Crimson Skulls are able to use this religious intolerance to their own ends, and they slowly subverted the Brotherhood of the Axe, drawing its leaders into the vile Chaos cult.\\n\\nCultists make pilgrimages to Middenheim once a year for the Convocation of Blood where they meet with the Cult Magus, a bloodthirsty killer named Boris Eichermann, a former Priest of Ulric who has a direct bloodline to the chief of the Teutogen tribe during the life of Sigmar. He faked his death five years ago after killing 35 young women with his bare hands.\\n\\nThe Crimson Skulls are cautious about recruiting new members. Most followers of Khorne are unstable and unsubtle – all virtues, but dangerous ones. The cult looks for individuals who, while committed to the spread of death and destruction, can temper their desires for violence with patience. They also recruit from natural opponents to the Sigmarites, and so many of their members begin as Priests or warriors dedicated to Ulric.\\n\\nViable candidates are selected from those with a penchant for killing, who can be easily seduced by violence. The candidate is invited to join an inner circle of an established military group where then the cultists inundate the candidate with anti-Sigmar propaganda. This continues until the candidate begins to spew his own lines of hatred, showing his rage and spite for the rival faith.\\n\\nThese fires are fuelled until the individual “accidentally” kills a Priest of Sigmar, almost always orchestrated and controlled by the Crimson Skulls (they set up the circumstances and dispose of the body afterwards). Terrified, the killer retreats to the cult for assistance. It is at this time that the cult inducts the murderer into their fold, ushering him into the true secrets of Khorne. Those who balk at the cult’s purpose are butchered and devoured by the rest.\\n\\nCrimson Skulls make regular offerings to their God. They believe each noble or Priest they kill is a sign of their devotion to their dark master. When they congregate, they always make a blood sacrifice, involving hours of physical combat, whereby they slaughter captives, and maybe even each other.\\n\\nAfter the orgy of violence, they select one of their prisoners to serve as the sacrifice. The leader then tears away the victim’s face, speaking an invocation in the tongue of Daemons while the victim thrashes about in agony. As the victim dies, the other cultists approach to carve chunks of hot flesh from his body and sip the blood as it sprays from the dying sacrifice.\\n	false

Sure, it is something to die slowly as the poison from a gut wound takes its time coursing through the body, leaving a victim to die slowly over many days, but it’s the children and the wives who are cast into poverty and destitution who must face untold hardships without the coin earned from soldiering or taking on a trade.\\n\\nMany women give up children to orphanages so they can feed the rest, whilst others offer the only commodity they have, their bodies, to make ends meet. But a few refuse to lie down and die, to face each day pinched with hunger, watching as their children perish from disease or starvation. A few fight back.\\n\\nIn the days following Chaos’s withdrawal, one sacked village behind enemy lines refused to surrender to the destitution promised to them by their community’s destruction. One woman, whose husband died fighting Daemons, rallied the rest, claiming there was no need to abandon what remained of their homes to begin the struggle of survival that faced so many in the north.\\n\\nNo, to flee their lives meant Chaos had won. Instead, she called upon the women to scour the battlefields, find swords and weapons, and learn to use them, lest the Beastmen feast upon their children and the women themselves become whores to the fat merchants and nobles in weak and crippled Middenheim.\\n\\nMaegin, the strong voice in the village, was the widowed wife of the town’s constable. While her husband lived, she pressed him to teach her to fight, so that if war ever broke out, she would be able to defend her home. Teach her he did, and as she feared, war broke out. In the end, she lost her home, husband, and all of her sons.\\n\\nThe losses filled her heart with hatred and rage. Instead of turning that hate towards the forces of Chaos, she looked back on the politicians, the merchants, and the decadent nobility who had made no sacrifice to save the Empire and directed her venom against them, those she believed had wronged her and her own.\\n\\nThrough sheer force of will, she constructed a group of like-minded women who had lost as much as she. Maegin taught the women to fight, to kill with passion, and to hate. So effective has she been that when a patrol of soldiers from Middenheim came through the area, Maegin and her force butchered the soldiers, and, consumed by their hatred, drank their blood and ate the flesh of the dying.\\n\\nA few of the women were ashamed and fled, but the rest felt the power to be had and saw Maegin as their spiritual leader. In the days that followed, Maegin’s force has raided isolated communities in the north, killing man, woman, and child, all under the pretence of weeding out the weak, but after four such massacres, the band has fallen fully under the sway of Chaos, becoming no better than the rampaging Chaos Marauders that first created it.\\n	false

gen_lore_nur_children_doom_description	Founded in Marienburg, the Children of Doom has thrived since the Black Plague of 1111. With disease rampant in the streets and the dead mounting, people fled to the temples begging for protection against the lethal plague that killed by the thousands. But in time, the plague affected even the cults, striking down Priests of Sigmar alongside those of Morr and Shallya. The dead were everywhere, and it seemed nowhere was safe. Then the Skaven came.\\n\\nFleeing the vile Ratmen and the winds of pestilence, a group of Priests barricaded the doors to the Temple of Sigmar, shutting out the evil to protect themselves. The mobs of frightened citizens would have no such protection, and while the Ratmen approached, the commoners pounded on the doors to gain entrance.\\n\\nThe frightened Priests withdrew to the catacombs, taking their food and supplies to wait out the violence. Once there, they heard the doors to the Temple splinter and break. They prayed to their God for deliverance, but Sigmar was deaf to their pleading, disdaining them for their cowardice.\\n\\nDespairing, one of their numbers called out to Nurgle for help. The clattering sounds above turned to screams as the Skaven invaders caught up with the desperate citizens. The sounds of battle and carnage carried to the frightened Priests: then, as soon as it began, silence descended and the Skaven went on their way.\\n\\nFeeling betrayed by Sigmar, they looked on Nurgle and the Priest who called to him with new respect. It was clear to them Sigmar was no more; they had lived a lie. The only powers, the only Gods, were those of Chaos. One by one, the Priests consecrated themselves to Father Nurgle, becoming his creatures. Thus were the Children of Doom born.\\n	false

A woman very experienced in the needs of a soldier, Reilla hoped to become rich from this jaunt.\\n\\nThere, however, she found neither wealth nor marriage to a suitable veteran, but instead death, decay, and disease. Her unit broke and quit the field. She fell behind, and a Chaos Warrior of Nurgle captured her. For five days, this diseased villain tortured her and exposed her to horrors best left unsaid. At the end of this hell, the Warrior released her, commanding her to spread what she learned.\\n\\nFor the rest of the war, Reilla wandered dazed, and each week she discovered some new horror ravaging her system. She turned to Nurgle for comfort, and the Lord of Decay provided her with followers – men and women who were similarly afflicted.\\n\\nThey saw Reilla as their saviour, a martyr, and to honour her, they gave her the title: The Foetid Maw. In time, she was too ill, too ravaged to walk, and far too hideous to behold, so her followers bore her in a closed palanquin, taking her from ruined village to ruined village, so she could share with the destitute what it was she learned from the Chaos Warrior.\\n\\nNow, the Foetid Maw and her entourage have found a new home in Wolfenburg.

They believe both experiences are but reflections of the same thing: the limits of Human endurance. To understand pure pleasure is to know pure pain, and vice versa.\\n\\nThe Sybarites include members of both genders, and they welcome all into their fold, from the mildly curious to the downright depraved. They have no interest in politics, though the numbers of nobles and politicians obviously bring a certain political sensibility. And religion matters not; there are plenty of Priests with hidden desires. They see themselves as the true ideologues of emotion, pleasure and agony, and they must slake their thirst in reaching the heights of bliss and the depths of sorrow, whenever and wherever they can.\\n\\nStarting small, they catered to the bored and curious courtiers in the Emperor’s court. What began as a few illicit meetings became something darker, something far more sinister. The orgies turned strange, exploring the forbidden, the fantastic, and the grotesque. And its members grew more daring in their exploits, creating something of a perverse subculture in the city. \\n\\nOver the next five centuries, the Sybarites were the worst-kept secret in the city. Any efforts to uncover them and their excesses were blocked by politicians and Priests, sometimes even by the Emperor himself. And then, in 1110, a stalwart Witch Hunter exposed the Arch Lector of Sigmar as a secret member of the organisation after a fire started mysteriously in the Temple.\\n\\nWhat followed was a terrible scandal that ultimately led Emperor Boris Goldgather to relocate his seat of power back to Altdorf while he resided in a palace in Carroburg. As history notes, this set in motion the terrible plagues and subsequent war that nearly destroyed the Empire.\\n\\nThe horrors that followed diverted attention from the conspiracy in Nuln as citizens fought for their very lives. The cultists learned a valuable lesson from this ordeal: they learned the need for secrecy. So, for the next thousand years, the Sybarites have remained in Nuln, maintaining their perversions as they always have, slowly corrupting the upper class and seducing men and women at all levels of government. Some whisper the Countess herself dabbles in the idle pursuits of the cult, though none would dare voice such treasonous thoughts.\\n	false

gen_lore_sla_bleak_society_subtitle	The Bleak Society	false
gen_lore_sla_bleak_society_description	One of the most common misunderstandings about Slaanesh is that this Chaos God is simply the patron of sadism and masochism, the personification of mortal sensuality and anguish. In truth, Slaanesh is the patron of desire, and not just desire for sexual gratification or perversity.\\n\\nMany mortals turn to the Lord of Pleasure to help achieve their every want, whether it be the inspiration to pen the perfect poem or to reach a greater position in society. But as with any other gift the Serpent bestows, such gains are never enough and his worshippers find themselves wanting more, finding themselves incapable of accepting where they are and what they have.\\n\\nOne group that embraces Slaanesh as the Fulfiller of Desires is the Bleak Society. Founded by a group of philosophers in Luccini, they formed a society dedicated to unravelling the mysteries of existence. But no matter how they argued, what proofs they cited, and what religious doctrines they examined, they could come to no agreement.\\n\\nSo the group turned to darker matters, foul and illegal tomes that held the perverse secrets of the Ruinous Powers. Their explorations revealed much, and they deduced that the Dark Gods were reflections of base Human emotions. Hate was no reason for life, nor was despair, or even hope, but pleasure, as a final cause, as a reason for existence, seemed the most intelligible. \\n\\nThrough their research, a few of the thinkers started appealing to the Lord of Pleasure for aid in their studies, helping them to find the perfect turn of phrase, the right paragraph to unlock the greater secrets of life. In time, others joined them. But each new finding created more problems, leading to bigger philosophical questions, driving the men mad with frustration until they finally embraced Slaanesh fully in the hopes of sorting through the riddle of existence.\\n\\nNow, years later, the scholars who came together in pursuit of wisdom are creatures of Chaos, riddled with mutations as they desperately work to gather more lore, to learn and to study with no regard for themselves or those they know. Still rather small, they were driven from Luccini years ago and are believed to be somewhere in the Empire now. They keep a low profile, but the sales of rare and suspicious books have been on the rise throughout the provinces.\\n	false

gen_lore_tze_purple_hand_subtitle	The Purple Hand	false
gen_lore_tze_purple_hand_description	Of the active Chaos cults, none are as powerful or as entrenched as the Purple Hand. This vast and well-connected organisation has agents scattered throughout the Empire, from the inner circles of the various knightly orders, to the Templars of Sigmar, to even the ranking Priests in the Empire’s cults.\\n\\nThey control merchants, nobles, artisans, and commoners alike. They create plans within plans, dealing in intrigues and corruption, spreading their taint to install individuals loyal to their mission in the highest places in the land. There is no accounting for the Purple Hand; they are everywhere.\\n\\nThe origin of the Purple Hand is unclear, shrouded in half-truths and lies. Some claim it emerged from Sartosan crime syndicates, evolving into its current form – a vast web of conspiracy with Tzeentch at the centre. Others theorise the cult has been active only in recent times, but the depth of their penetration into Imperial society seems to suggest otherwise.\\n\\nThe most famous efforts of this cult centre on their attempt to murder Boris Todbringer and replace the Emperor, Karl Franz, with a puppet ruler (though some claim the cult attempted to replace Karl Franz’s son and only heir). The Cult of Sigmar, as well as Palace authorities, have remained decidedly silent about this plot, but most realise the Purple Hand was very close to achieving their goals.\\n\\nMore recently, the Purple Hand worked to locate Sigmar reborn, though ultimately their efforts were thwarted by Luthor Huss’s fortuitous discovery. In short, the Purple Hand makes no small endeavours; no, they care nothing for the small victory, instead being trained on the ultimate prize: controlling the Empire.\\n	false

gen_lore_tze_red_crown_subtitle	The Red Crown	false
gen_lore_tze_red_crown_description	The Red Crown is an aggressive and active force in the Empire. Where other Cults infiltrate established organisations, corrupting them from within, the Red Crown instead recruits members from the Beastmen, Mutants, and other vagabonds that haunt the dim places between the towns and cities. They believe that the only way to destroy the Empire is through brute force. Regular attacks by the horrors of the wilds demoralise the people, forcing them to cast their lot in with the cult, thereby strengthening its numbers, or dying in the process. \\n\\nThe Red Crown’s most common tactic is to ambush travellers, the bigger the better. Tipped off by sympathisers in the cities, the hordes of twisted outcasts pour out from the shadows to tear their enemies to pieces. This strategy only works so long as they maintain the lines of communication with their allies.\\n\\nSo, the Red Crown makes use of sleeper agents to facilitate the flow of information. As with other cults of Tzeentch, these are well-placed powerful individuals who are committed to the destruction of Imperial order. The rest of the cult’s efforts are spent towards swelling the ranks. These individuals scour the villages and countryside to harvest Mutants and mould them into Red Crown foot soldiers.\\n\\nAt the head of this cult is the Master of Change. Although there have been many Magi over the life of this cult, the title never changes. Counted amongst his loyal lieutenants is a perverse assortment of Mutants utterly devoted to the cult’s cause. The Master of Change also employs Wizards and Chaos Warriors, as well as Bestigor Chieftains to muster more Beastmen.\\n\\nIt’s believed this cult operates out of Altdorf, though every effort to uncover them has met with failure. As the leadership may work from there, most of its members can be found spread through the nearby Reikwald, Great Forest and the Drakwald.\\n	false
